21,"I have so much to ask you... after this match."
22,"You shall rot in my light."
23,"I like it here more than anywhere else in the world."
24,"I'm owe you a debt. Time to pay it back!"

26,"Calm down! When the time has come, you will know."

42,"If you dare stand against me, I'll make you sleep under this cold ground forever!"
43,"Bringer of death, it's time for your own."
44,"I'm in quite a hurry, I don't have time to play games with an idiot like you."
45,"It's my pleasure to fight against you."
46,"Situation green. Proceed to eliminate the enemy."
47,"Fate deals you cards, but it's up to you to use them."

53,"I wonder what the entrails of a doll look like."
54,"I will give you a traitor's death."
55,"What's the matter, having another episode?"
56,"This one monitors the whole, there is no one who cannot be seen."
57,"A match? Certainly."
58,"I know it's rude, but please have a match with me, Mrs. Redgrave?"
59,"You are possessed by a chaos demon. You're a fool not to know it."

67,"I don't have time to deal with your foolishness."
68,"I will guide this lost ghost to the afterlife."
69,"What do we fight for? For the world? Or for ourselves?"
70,"Sorry but I don't have time to apologize for injustices past."
71,"To me, the world's secret is existence itself."
72,"Doctor, I thought I'd never see you again."
73,"I won't forgive you."
74,"You don't look so good."
75,"I'll show you the power of a divine beast."
76,"My divine beasts never lose."
77,"Sprout, out of my way! I don't want to fight with you."
78,"Sorry but don't interrupt me now."
79,"This is a good chance to experience a Mechanical Soldier's strength."
80,"I am prepared to accept my fate at last."
81,"Now that you have seen me, I cannot allow you to continue living."

83,"I don't have time to waste on you, brat."
84,"As if such as you could comprehend my true intent."
85,"I would have you demonstrate these renowned fencing skills I hear about."
86,"I won't go easy on you, Asura."
87,"I'll show you no mercy."
88,"There's something I have to protect at all cost!"
89,"Captain, please stand back."
90,"I didn't think I'd ever see you again, Florence."
91,"You've been plotting, haven't you Asura?"
92,"Stubborn woman, I'll finish you by my own hand."
93,"Tsk, looks like things got messy."
94,"Sorry, but could you perhaps fight someone else?"
95,"When the heavens align we will be vindicated!"
96,"The shining Empire will rule all!"
97,"You and I are not so different. If only..."
98,"My, you're an incorrigible fellow. Let's finish this."
99,"You must overcome your fears."
100,"We are beyond petty mercy."
101,"The evening's entertainment looks to be commencing!"
102,"Flowers are beautiful because they are short lived."
103,"I wonder if there's any meaning to this fight."
104,"This too is fated. Let's enjoy the game!"
105,"The scent of flowers invigorates the spirit. It would be even better if you have talent."
106,"Those who live by the sword, die bye the sword. That's all there is to it!"
107,"This unending conflict has changed the world."
108,"Whatever thoughts or ideas you have will pop and vanish like a bubble if you lose."
109,"Even if I have no reason to fight, I still seek victory."
110,"The victor is the last one standing."
111,"Sorry but you'll be dying for me here. Don't struggle."
112,"Bring it on, if you want to die."
113,"I can't afford to lose here, no matter what."
114,"Sorry about your senseless death. I won't be pulling any punches!"
115,"If you underestimate my power you will pay with pain."
116,"Blood for blood."
117,"I'm not afraid of death, at last I'll get some peace."
118,"You have no idea how much life irritates me..."
119,"Death is not the end... right?"
120,"Death is light. The last light that shines in this dark world."
121,"Do you actually think you can win against me with moves like that?"
122,"You're about to experience some advanced fencing!"
123,"Don't worry I'll give you a fair fight."
124,"I'm used to troublemakers. Bring it!"
125,"Eternal war, that's what I want!"
126,"Here it comes, think you're ready?"
127,"Another bothersome encounter."
128,"No need to brag, just have to fight."
129,"I can't allow this to be the end. Here I go!"
130,"I still have things to do. Nothing personal!"
131,"Have you seen it? That dark world..."
132,"Is this a dream or reality? Huh, I guess it doesn't matter."
133,"All my wishes come true. Be careful!"
134,"It's not my fault... It's just..."
135,"Could you just leave me alone?"
136,"You know I can't lose. It's just fate."
137,"Nobody can escape their fate. Except me, anyway."
138,"You know I've already beaten you over and over, right?"
139,"If you're disappointed by life, best not to fight it eh?"
140,"You really think you want to see me in action?"
141,"Go ahead kid, draw your sword."
142,"Don't do something you'll regret unless you'll have time to regret it."
143,"If you want to live any longer you'll have to defeat me first."
144,"Stop and think. Do you really have any chance of winning here?"
145,"Your actions, good or bad, will follow you through life."

151,"It's judgment time. Don't worry, you'll only suffer a moment."
152,"You shall rot in my light."
153,"At least let's end this painlessly."
154,"No matter the sacrifice, my defense will be absolute."
155,"You have some hopes for the outcome of this fight? Regardless..."
156,"My blood will cost you."
157,"Hey Rob, it's dinnertime!"
158,"No need to be afraid, you'll die one day anyway."
159,"You need motivation? I'll give you as much as you need!"
160,"Ok you can relax now, you're about to die."
161,"Good or bad, your actions will be rewarded in kind."
162,"I fight for my mission. What is your reason for fighting?"
163,"I don't have time for this. Don't get in my way!"
164,"I'll have you put back anything you've misappropriated."
165,"It's not too late, there's still a future I must protect."
166,"I will not be merciful. Prepare yourself."
167,"There are times when sympathy can be harmful."
168,"My blade grows dull."
169,"This is not where I will die."
170,"You will face a darkness... A darker darkness than death itself."
171,"I will be your opponent. Come at me!"

173,"When I cut you it will hurt. And then you die!"
174,"This is a battle you cannot escape."
175,"It doesn't matter what I say here, this is probably going to end in a fight."
176,"Well well... I hope this will be a useful experiment."
177,"Show me something interesting!"
178,"How many of this world's mysteries do you know?"
179,"This is a waste of time. Allow me to end it quickly."
180,"This isn't a fate you can reverse, you know."
181,"We shall have an excellent time together."
182,"The darkness will devour all. So..."
183,"It's only ok if you can keep fighting."
184,"Everything comes to an end. Can we do this painlessly?"
185,"Do you know true darkness? I do..."
186,"I will show no mercy if you stand in my way."
187,"As if I could give up, in a place like this!"
188,"There's something I just have to do, no matter what!"
189,"Don't look down on me because I'm a kid!"
190,"I just have to fight!"
191,"Don't you just love the sweet smell of a cold grave?"
192,"Will you too show me your death?"
193,"Die, and serve me forever."
194,"Tee hee, smells like death."
195,"I really would have loved everyone to die for me..."
196,"I'm in quite a hurry, I don't have time to play games with an idiot like you."
197,"Looks like a pretty interesting fight."
198,"You're interfering with my studies. Clear off!"
199,"It's not bad to exercise once in a while."
200,"I need you for my research. Die already!"
201,"Situation green. Proceed to eliminate the enemy."
202,"I'm going to win this match for the glory of Aurora Company!"
203,"For royal justice, I will continue to fight!"
204,"Nobody may besmirch the Kingdom's honor!"
205,"I would give my life for honor."

212,"Go away you filthy barbarian!"
213,"Looks like you really want to be sliced apart by my wires."
214,"Only Redgrave may control the world."
215,"I have already made my arrangements."
216,"This one observes the whole world, without omission."
217,"That power only remains to humans. This one will dispose of it responsibly."
218,"Retaliation shall be equal in strength."
219,"Stand clear, ignorant human."
220,"This one is charged with protecting this world. You may not interfere."
221,"The fire will burn everything. Everything."
222,"It would be so nice if this was an actual challenge."
223,"It would be so nice if this was an actual challenge."
224,"I just incinerated everything. Prepare yourself!"
225,"Leave me, I will be free of this!"
226,"Everything is controlled by nothingness. I will make an offering of you."
227,"Everything is weak before this force."
228,"You will regret our encounter."
229,"Even if I turn the whole world against me, there's something I must do."
230,"I will fight to the end, wherever that may be."
231,"What do we fight for? For the world? Or for ourselves?"
232,"People mimic machines, machines mimic people."
233,"It appears this world will be a fascinating experience."
234,"You cannot create something without destroying something."
235,"I just remembered. Everything!"
236,"There's something I have to protect at all cost!"
237,"Kingdom of Lubiona, Aurora Company, Florence! Reporting!"
238,"You are about to feel the power of an Armor Hunter!"
239,"Understood, exterminate all hostiles."
240,"I'm not afraid to die!"
241,"I'll show you what holy beasts can do!"
242,"My holy beasts absolutely cannot lose!"
243,"I will protect everyone with my power."
244,"Out of the way! I really don't want to hurt anyone!"
245,"Sylph! Don't hold back!"
246,"I am prepared to accept my fate at last."
247,"Now that you have seen me, I cannot allow you to continue living."
248,"Light cannot exist without shadow."
249,"My techniques cannot be anticipated."
250,"I can't die a pawn in some ruler's scheme."
251,"Tsk, looks like things got messy."
252,"Sorry, but could you perhaps fight someone else?"
253,"Looks like you chose the wrong side!"
254,"I'm hate these fight scenes but it looks like there's no other way."
255,"I'll have to charge extra for this..."
256,"When the heavens align we will be vindicated!"
257,"The shining Empire will rule all!"
258,"The world's suffering is our own suffering. It must be healed."
259,"People suffer because they have hope. You should give up your hope."
260,"Aimless dead, decay to nothing."
261,"The evening's entertainment looks to be commencing!"
262,"Flowers are beautiful because they are short lived."
263,"I wonder if there's any meaning to this fight."
264,"This too is fated. Let's enjoy the game!"
265,"The scent of flowers invigorates the spirit. It would be even better if you have talent."
266,"Young one, acknowledging your betters also requires courage."
267,"You really want me to cut you down don't you?"
268,"Will you taste the blade of an old fool?"
269,"I will show you the forbidden techniques I have acquired through the years."
270,"It's not over until I'm dead. I will protect the future!"
271,"Do you really think you can defeat me, Izac?"
272,"Even the most painful memories are still a distant past."
273,"Time passes, wherever you are."
274,"Let's finish everything here."
275,"I never though I would meet you."
276,"This won't go the same way as last time, Friedrich."
277,"We should have ended this last time."
278,"So we've both changed?"
279,"Show me a Custode's true strength."
280,"Why don't we have a quick match, Eva?"
281,"You're obsessed with death, Grunwald."
282,"Looks like I just can't get rid of you."
283,"You're just as thoughtless as you ever were."
284,"I can see where you're aiming. You're going to miss."
285,"I'm owe you a debt. Time to pay it back!"
286,"I'm going to take to you down, Blaise."
287,"So you've learned a thing or two since we last met, Bernhard?"
288,"I'll show you the skills you taught me."
289,"I've run into a difficult woman, now!"
290,"Looks like we're fighting then."
291,"I'll enjoy this! I always wanted to take you on."
292,"I have no need of sentiments such as [nostalgia]."
293,"I like it here more than anywhere else in the world."
294,"Have we met before?"
295,"I'm obsessed with death? I guess we have that in common."
296,"In the end the only thing you'll find in battle is death."
297,"Woman who brings death... You are going down."
298,"In the end we are all obsessed with death."
299,"Come at me, Evarist!"
300,"You'll never change. A bout for old times' sake!"
301,"Which of us is stronger, let's decide once more."
302,"Shall we go a round, Leon?"
303,"Well, well... Can't believe I'm seeing you here, Jead."
304,"My sword will best your gun."
305,"I cannot be killed by you, Blaise."
306,"I'll not lose to the likes of you."
307,"I'll allow you to test my strength."
308,"I can see through your attacks."
309,"We meet again at last."
310,"You always were a simpleton."
311,"Stop playing, Grunwald."
312,"I missed you, Abel."
313,"There's something we should talk about before we fight, you and me."
314,"Your blade is cursed, Blaise."
315,"So even one such as yourself loses it sometimes?"
316,"I'll bring my full strength, instructor."
317,"What a creepy woman..."
318,"I'll have you pay for your betrayal."
319,"You again? Gimme a break!"
320,"Traitor!"
321,"What am I supposed to do?!"
322,"We need to end this, Abel."
323,"I don't need anybody's assistance!"
324,"I will end you as many times as you like!"
325,"I will blow you completely away."
326,"You'll never win, no matter how many times we fight!"
327,"I'm not so old as to lose to a rabble like you!"
328,"Stay calm Leon. Rage is an ugly habit."
329,"Jead? I'm fighting you?"
330,"You may draw first, out of respect for our friendship."
331,"If it started with you it will end with you."
332,"Stop struggling, Rosso."
333,"You will pay your debt, Milian."
334,"Sorry young lady but I can't let you get in my way."
335,"..."
336,"This is the end. Of everything."
337,"Just how stubborn are you?!"
338,"I have just the word for you, Grunwald. Compassion!"
339,"None of your attacks will work on me."
340,"Your blades are useless against me."
341,"It seems your guns have not rusted."
342,"We must finish this nonsense presently."
343,"So our swords have crossed at last."
344,"Abominable woman, get out of my sight!"
345,"I have let go of my past!"
346,"I know this smell..."
347,"Get away, annoying girl."
348,"Disgusting woman."
349,"Doctor, I thought I wouldn't meet you again."
350,"Oh, hello there..."
351,"But we don't have any reason to fight!"
352,"Sprout? Is that you?"
353,"So it's you. You fooled us all!"
354,"This is not the end of the world, Evarist"
355,"You're out of danger but what has been gained, Izac?"
356,"You cannot defeat me."
357,"I would engage you in combat."
358,"Draw your sword, Friedrich."
359,"It is my destiny to fight you."
360,"Show me your ability."
361,"What kind of man sells out his comrades?"
362,"I'll not relax my guard enough to lose to you."
363,"Haven't seen you in a while... Any better this time around?"
364,"I never wanted to meet you in battle."
365,"Haven't seen you in a while... Any better this time around?"
366,"Ah, this is going to be difficult."
367,"You don't need to go easy on me, Bernhard."
368,"You'll pay your debts, Rosso!"
369,"Show me these legendary skills."
370,"This time I'll have you fight me fairly."
371,"Show me what you've got!"
372,"I found you at last... Show me your power!"
373,"You show your face again? Stubborn, aren't you."
374,"You want to take me on? It won't be easy."
375,"I won't say no to the chance to measure your power."
376,"You know dolls are a disturbing habit?"
377,"It's been a long time but never again. Prepare to die!"
378,"Guys like you are so irritating!"
379,"I will take everything back from you."
380,"I will not forgive you."
381,"I was looking for you... my dear sister!"
382,"Stop tormenting everyone!"
383,"I'm good enough not to lose to you, Ada!"
384,"Reserved."
385,"Sorry, don't interrupt me now."
386,"You'll not see mercy from me!"
387,"Why is it you have to wage war all the time?"
388,"Let's kill you properly this time, shall we?"
389,"If you dare stand against me, I'll make you sleep under this cold ground forever!"
390,"What... is this feeling?"
391,"Humans aren't the only things that can die."
392,"If you dare stand against me, I'll make you sleep under this cold ground forever!"
393,"You're a cute boy aren't you? I'll kill you especially gently."
394,"I'll murder you over and over..."
395,"I do not require your direction any more."
396,"You sunk my most precious vessel with your weapons. Your death will be a fitting apology."
397,"Reserved."
398,"I'm not stupid enough to be to be bound a ridiculous past."
399,"Show me your true power. Quickly!"
400,"You're pretty tenacious, I'll give you that."
401,"I don't really have time to take care of you properly."
402,"I'm kind of interested in seeing this power of yours."
403,"That was just a small test. Don't hold back."
404,"Show me those sword skills."
405,"You're the one Sprout was looking for!"
406,"Don't be shy, fight me!"
407,"I'm going to seal away your wicked powers for good!"
408,"I didn't think I'd ever see you again, Florence."
409,"With Palmo as my opponent, I can't take it easy can I?"
410,"I won't go easy on you, Asura."
411,"I will be serving as your opponent, Archduke."
412,"Machines have their own way of doing things."
413,"It's been a very long time indeed!"
414,"How've you been, Browning?"
415,"Right, let us begin."
416,"Reserved."
417,"I'm don't care about revenge, but I will put an end to this."
418,"What's the matter, having another episode?"
419,"I will give you a traitor's death."
420,"I wonder what the entrails of a doll look like."
421,"I know it's rude, but please have a match with me, Mrs. Redgrave?"
422,"Have you concluded your business, Doctor?"
423,"Your work as an inquisitor was quite something."
424,"Your bodywork is exquisite."
425,"You are possessed by a chaos demon. You're a fool not to know it."
426,"Thank you for your assistance. You will be rewarded."
427,"Your power will bring chaos upon the world."
428,"A match? It's not bad for me."
429,"Time to settle things."
430,"My, you're an incorrigible fellow. Let's finish this."
431,"You, want to fight me? Getting a bit uppity there Archibald."
432,"Let me see what you've got."
433,"No greetings necessary. Just fight."
434,"No greetings necessary. Just fight."
435,"This brings back memories. Interesting!"
436,"If everything ends, then it will all begin anew. I won't let you get in the way."
437,"I want to show you what I've seen."
438,"I will guide this lost ghost to the afterlife."
439,"Allow me to test your strength."
440,"I don't have time to deal with your foolishness."
441,"You don't look so good."
442,"Sorry but I don't have time to apologize for injustices past."
443,"Taking on so many functions, it's no wonder you've developed a problem personality."
444,"So you're the one who's been encouraging Donita."
445,"To me, the world's secret is existence itself."
446,"You cursed powers will be sealed away for good when I'm done with you!"
447,"Captain, please stand back."
448,"So you're Palmo. I'm listening."
449,"You've been plotting, haven't you Asura?"
450,"This must be terrifying for you, but I will be your opponent."
451,"You, are you perhaps Ayn?"
452,"Sprout, out of my way. I don't wanna fight with you."
453,"You've been hurting people! I won't let you get away with that!"
454,"This is a good chance to experience a Mechanical Soldier's strength."
455,"I'll show you no mercy."
456,"Luka, why do I have to fight you?"
457,"I would have you demonstrate these renowned fencing skills I hear about."
458,"I don't have time to bother with a brat like you."
459,"Ominous flower. Let us settle this."
460,"Stubborn woman, I'll finish you by my own hand."
461,"As if such as you could comprehend my true intent."
462,"You must overcome your fears."
463,"Let's decide whose skills are greater."
464,"I've seen you somewhere before..."
465,"So nice to see a familiar face! I was all alone out here."
466,"Oh, but this brings back memories."
467,"If you are a servant of the empire, serving us too is only polite."
468,"We are beyond petty mercy."
469,"Power means nothing if you die obtaining it."
470,"You and I are not so different. If only..."
471,"Do not think you can escape the great Marseus."
472,"Even the most beautiful flower eventually falls..."
473,"Melen. Fighting you is going to be rough."
474,"Good night."
475,"Do you like whips, Detective?"
476,"Now we'll see whose sword is sharper!"
477,"Put away your sword, Sprout. I have no quarrel with you."
478,"Servant of the King, prepare to be executed."
479,"Do we really have to fight, Ada?"
480,"I never thought you and I would cross blades."
481,"What could cause loyal subjects to be at odds?"
482,"Palmo, I'm so sorry."
483,"Asura, you'll not see mercy from me!"
484,"Our quarrel is not over."
485,"This is all sooo ridiculous. But fun!"
486,"Ha ha! Why so serious?"
487,"Won't you die with me?"
488,"Ha ha! Why so serious?"
489,"Hey I sort of want to die, you think you could kill me?"
490,"You're so cute I could kill you!"
491,"Heh heh heh."
492,"Tee hee."
493,"I always have righteousness on my side."
494,"I can't afford to let a villain walk past unhindered."
495,"I protect everything. This is my duty."
496,"I'm here to right what is wrong."
497,"Victory is proof of righteousness!"
498,"You're not trustworthy, but I'll acknowledge your strength."
499,"I swear, you are actually completely crazy."
500,"I, uh... What are you doing here?"
501,"Um, excuse me. Combat's outside my area of expertise..."
502,"I've never heard of anything like this..."
503,"Well, such is life..."
504,"MY SCIENTIFIC PROWESS IS UNRIVALLED! Oh, you weren't watching."
505,"What, Ayn? Hey, stop that!"
506,"Ah, excuse me, I was just leaving."
507,"I really have to thank you for getting me involved in all of this."
508,"What, you're still here? Oh well, let's enjoy ourselves."
509,"Allow me to clean up."
510,"I have no use for such as you."
511,"Conversation is meaningless. Die, maggot."
512,"The whole world is corrupt, so why fight it?"
513,"I'll see you dead at my feet."
514,"You're always in the way, kid."
515,"So the real monster was just this tiny brat?"
516,"I won't go easy on you!"
517,"I don't need this."
518,"Nice suit. It looks good on you."
519,"Flowers, death, apples..."
520,"Where's that music coming from...?"
521,"Agh, that ghastly voice! When will it stop?!"
522,"It hurts... please, somebody..."
523,"Ow ow ow ow!"
524,"I think I'm going to throw up..."
525,"Calm down Evelyn. It's ok, I'm here now."
526,"It's ok, just leave me be."
527,"I'm honored to be your last opponent."
528,"Life's too short, don't you think?"
529,"Please be gentle with me."
530,"Life is fleeting, and in that beautiful."
531,"So this is the end."
532,"I'll thank you for this someday."
533,"When you remembered it all, was there anything about a holy woman...?"
534,"There's a melody that flows between life and death, you know. I'll allow you to hear it, if you like."
535,"The wise man plays, the fool listens. That is our relationship."
536,"Ah revenge's sweet refrain, I could listen to it over and over."
537,"My retribution will be like an unending melody."
538,"When this song ends, so will your life."
539,"I'll play this song at your funeral."
540,"Where does it hurt?"
541,"Shall we begin your treatment?"
542,"This won't hurt a bit!"
543,"If there's nothing wrong with you why are you here?"
544,"Ohh that feels weird. I can hear that voice again..."
545,"I'm not your Mom!"
546,"Squee! Mummy! Play with me?"
547,"I just remembered who you are..."
548,"Nobody can stand against the will of God."
549,"We will fight to bring about God's plan."
550,"Free will is an illusion, everything is destined."
551,"We do as God wills."
552,"God creates the future."
553,"Show me your strength."
554,"God has a special hell set aside for you."
555,"Conflict requires blood."
556,"It's all your fault! Everyone is suffering!"
557,"Won't you play with me?"
558,"Life is short so let's enjoy this."
559,"What's the matter, don't you like fun?"
560,"I live only for pleasure. I'm sure you're just the same!"
561,"I don't care how things end, as long as I had fun."
562,"I don't do nostalgia."
563,"Birgit, you came to see me."
564,"Meeting again in a place like this? I can only say it's fate."
565,"Beauty is the ultimate meaning."
566,"Beauty can surpass death itself."
567,"All the world's beauty is there for me alone."
568,"Don't make me angry, I'm ugly when I'm angry."
569,"[There is beauty in harmony], these are the ethics of a warrior."
570,"Ah, it's Birgit. You are as beautiful as ever!"
571,"Do not forget your role, Kuhn."
572,"The fleeting days are as vapor..."
573,"I heard somebody's voice, I really did..."
574,"Is there color in a world without pain or sadness?"
575,"If we just waited here forever, what do you think would change?"
576,"If winter comes, every flower will wither and die."
577,"Uh..."
578,"Um..."
579,"Maestro..."
580,"I..."
581,"..."
582,"It's been a while, Shalott."
583,"How've you been Shalott? Well?"
584,"Battle documentation commenced. I would find it agreeable if you are strong."
585,"You will serve as my laboratory workbench."
586,"I will prove my thesis here!"
587,"Don't you dare break until I say so."
588,"I will use your body to verify the effectiveness of my military weaponry."
589,"It doesn't matter what I am told, I was right to create that child."
590,"How would you like to sample some of my spectacular arsenal?"
591,"Come, give me a demonstration of this power of yours."
592,"C.C., you are an exceptional scientist. But I cannot brook competition."
593,"Tyrel, your sins are many. I will not exact penance."
594,"Compassion aside, this one will not be defied."
595,"This guy creeps me out..."
596,"Tyrel, I never looked down on you. Not even once."
597,"Are you a bounty hunter too? Well anyway if you get in my way I will cut you down."
598,"I don't usually like to pick my fights so indiscriminately, but..."
599,"I don't normally like to show this power to strangers, but I guess it can't be helped."
600,"I don't really want to die either! So I'm coming at you with everything!"
601,"So you're after my scalp eh? I'll trade it for your life!"
602,"So you want a bout with me, Riesz?"
603,"I'll not go quietly, Inquisitor. Prepare yourself!"
604,"My life is in chaos because of you guys. You are about to experience pain."
605,"You would face my flames? If you're serious I'm ready, Rudia."
606,"Ignorant bounty hunter. I will punish you for speaking ill of Redgrave."
607,"So you want to know my true form? Me too!"
608,"Oh come on. It's not like I came here to fight!"
609,"I'm so bored with fighting. Hurry up and disappear!"
610,"So you came here to become my victim too?"
611,"I just want to live quietly, so why does this keep happening?"
612,"Your Highness... I'm so glad you're safe..."
613,"Your power... what on earth is it?!"
614,"You mean this time I'm fighting... an Armor Hunter?!"
615,"While I'm here Major Kurt, is there perhaps something I've been searching for nearby?"
616,"Chief of the Lonsbrough Army Battalion, could one such as I beg audience?"
617,"You, I met you at the Eternal Fortress in Treide."
618,"It's like I'm trapped in a dream while awake."
619,"You know, I've already completed my observations of you."
620,"All of your actions are recorded, even in this moment."
621,"Is this a dream? When will I wake?"
622,"Even if you forget everything you know, the mission will remain. I'm so cynical..."
623,"That we could meet once more, it's like a dream!"
624,"Hey Rudia, do you think there's something wrong with me?"
625,"Even the wise don't always get the things they want."
626,"The power to subvert cause and effect. Show it to me Jead!"
627,"Your power... because of me...?"
628,"Is that really you, Mary?"
629,"Do you know who I am?"
630,"No."
631,"Feels like something's unfinished... Maybe I'll remember it in a while."
632,"Where do we go after we get out of this forest?"
633,"Off to fight new monsters."
634,"Here we go again..."
635,"Do you have any idea where I am going?"
636,"All I am told is to keep going forward."
637,"... Looks like I am stuck with you until I remember who I really am."
638,"That guy back there doesn't seem like much."
639,"Let's go to the next place"
640,"Leave it to me; I'll cut them all down."
641,"It's gotten quiet."
642,"Yeah."
643,"... Can't you be just a little bit more courteous?"
644,"Everywhere I go, it feels disjointed... am I still trapped in this fleeting world?"
645,"Perhaps."
646,"But, this ground I am standing on, this is reality."
647,"And if I continue on, I can open the gates of destiny, right?"
648,"... Maybe."
649,"How cold. Don't you have any feelings?"
650,"What should I do?"
651,"Keep going forward."
652,"It'd be great if we could find a pub ahead."
653,"... ..."
654,"Let's keep going, shall we?"
655,"... ..."
656,"We've been walking for a while now. Tired?"
657,"I'm fine."
658,"All right, where do we go next?"
659,"We've finally made it out of those dark and depressing woods."
660,"Yeah."
661,"... That's all you're gonna say? You're as unpleasant as this forest."
662,"Are you hurt?"
663,"No."
664,"Very well then, where do we go next?"
665,"I understand what is going on. So we'll just keep going forward like this?"
666,"Yes"
667,"It seems I need to understand a bit more about this world that has summoned me."
668,"It's too weak to be a match for me!"
669,"Let's go to the next location, shall we?"
670,"No problem!"
671,"Such an interesting place! I wonder what awaits us ahead? Can't wait to find out!"
672,"Is that so?"
673,"Traveling in this strange world is good at all, but it would be nice too if I can remember who I am."
674,"We've finally made it out of this forest. I wonder what lies ahead?"
675,"I don't know."
676,"And you call yourself a guide. You're no help at all."
677,"Everything feels so eerie; I didn't know such a world existed."
678,"I don't understand."
679,"Don't you have any questions at all? Even if the world is so strange?"
680,"A world without the smell of death... How strange."
681,"Smell?"
682,"Precisely. I love the smell of blood and conflict. Will I find those if I keep going forward?"
683,"Looks like I got myself into a sticky situation."
684,"Are you all right?"
685,"Heh, those were nothing. I just don't like getting into meaningless fights."
686,"We're through the forest. Which way should we go?"
687,"That way."
688,"All right. Let me know if we're changing directions."
689,"We have put some distance between us and the mansion. Are you tired?"
690,"No"
691,"Well then, let's keep going, so we can find out who we are."
692,"Such a dull and boring world."
693,"Now is the time to go forward."
694,"I guess we'll know the truth one day."
695,"Everything looks like disjointed fragments. What a strange world this is."
696,"Is that so?"
697,"Little dolls and strange world... feels like I am in a dream."
698,"We're out of the forest. Where to now?"
699,"Over there."
700,"Let me handle this, I am used to dealing with monsters."
701,"Can't seem to shake free of these fights. Where do we go now?"
702,"Lady Goddess says to go forward."
703,"I have no idea what's going on here. Guess I'll just have to follow you for now."
704,"Why am I here?"
705,"It's time to go forward."
706,"All right, whatever you say..."
707,"The way opens up after leaving the forest, so we'll have easier time spotting enemies."
708,"Is that so?"
709,"The more limited the view the more dangerous it is. Don't leave my side."
710,"What an eerie forest; can't hear even a single bird call..."
711,"Even so, we still have to move forward."
712,"I wonder what will become of us..."
713,"I'm not done testing my powers yet."
714,"The road ahead is still long."
715,"Let's go get our powers back."
716,"Hmm... seems like I've arrived in an impossible place."
717,"Let's move forward."
718,"Well, well. I guess there's only one thing to do."
719,"I am starting to like this world now."
720,"The road ahead is still long."
721,"If it's going to be this pleasant all the time, then I like it."
722,"All right, we have come this far. Are you sure we need to go further?"
723,"Just keep going."
724,"All right, whatever you say then."
725,"I need time to think about what we should do here."
726,"Move it now!"
727,"Someone is in a hurry. But it looks like this is the only way."
728,"All right, Ms. Doll, what do we do now?"
729,"Just keep going forward, that's all."
730,"Same old answers. Oh well, guess I'll just kill everyone then, hahahaha!"
731,"Well then, where do we go next?"
732,"There."
733,"I don't want to be stuck in this world forever. Let's move!"
734,"Whew, we made it out of the forest. Should we take a break?"
735,"We don't have time for it."
736,"Well, the road ahead is still long, and I am not sure we'll make it through in our current state."
737,"What am I supposed to do in this place?"
738,"Just keep going and you'll find out."
739,"Tsk, don't think I am going to do everything you say!"
740,"Um, Ms. Doll, where are we going exactly?"
741,"I don't know. All I know is where we need to go."
742,"Is that so? I guess I'll just follow you."
743,"Are you sure it's ok to leave this big house?"
744,"I don't see any problem with it."
745,"Well, if you say so, then I'll do what you say."
746,"Where is this going to end?"
747,"For now, just keep going forward."
748,"Looks like the road ahead is still long. There's no choice but to keep on going."
749,"Where are we going exactly?"
750,"Somewhere far ahead of us."
751,"Really? I'll stick with you then."
752,"Hey Ms. Pointman, which way now?"
753,"There's a bigger threat ahead."
754,"It's all part of the trial. Bring it on!"
755,"Never had such experiences before. Well, as long as it's exciting, I am fine with it."
756,"The road ahead is still long."
757,"Right. Well, anything is fine as long as it's fun."
758,"What an interesting world, strange and yet beautiful."
759,"Keep going forward."
760,"You seem to be in a hurry, even for a machine."
761,"What's going to happen if we keep going forward?"
762,"Going forward is the duty that we have been entrusted to."
763,"So, you and me, all we have to do is keep going forward, right?"
764,"I wonder how such an irrational world can exist... food for thought."
765,"We don't have the time to go around."
766,"Didn't expect to hear that from a doll... You'll make a fine study subject."
767,"Can't believe I've been assigned to guard over a doll."
768,"Is there any problem?"
769,"... You will be cuter if you act more the way you look."
770,"I can't see our objective. Where exactly are we going?"
771,"I don't know, but keep on going."
772,"Just keep on going, huh? So I will find out who I am once we get there..."
773,"Here and there are the same, everything seems so familiar..."
774,"We don't have time to stop."
775,"What a cold Doll you are. Can't even have time for Deja Vu?"
776,"I see..."
777,"What?"
778,"Nothing, just remembered something, who I am really..."
779,"Hmm... This guy's tough."
780,"It's no problem."
781,"Easy for you to say. You just stay back and watch!"
782,"Anyway, the enemy is down."
783,"All right, let's keep going."
784,"Being ordered to fight by a doll... what have I gotten myself into?"
785,"It seems like we're forced to fight wherever we go in this world."
786,"Your point being?"
787,"Nothing, it's a perfect opportunity for me to practice my sword skills."
788,"Whew, we defeated it. Is there going to be more of those ahead?"
789,"I believe so."
790,"No kidding! Can't someone else take care of them?"
791,"I know things far worse than these monsters."
792,"You mean such things exist in this world?"
793,"The Abyss is accompanying me. You'll understand someday..."
794,"I think I remember something... even if it's only bits and pieces."
795,"Is that so?"
796,"Hmm... How cold. At least I know my strengths are needed here."
797,"So it means I have to fight monsters in this world as well."
798,"Is there any problems?"
799,"No, no, just a simple warm-up exercise."
800,"... ..."
801,"What's wrong?"
802,"... ..."
803,"What do we do after this?"
804,"Let's keep moving."
805,"I guess we have to fight before finding our true selves."
806,"Ha! Too easy"
807,"Really?"
808,"Ok, where do we go now? I can't move unless you go forward."
809,"We must hurry."
810,"Yes, that's your destiny."
811,"I understand, but I feel like there's something I have to do..."
812,"The enemies seem stronger here."
813,"They will be more to come."
814,"My skills are not rusty yet. I will defeat them all."
815,"Just as I was fighting, some memories returned."
816,"Is that so?"
817,"Hmm, I feel like something still needs to be done... Let's go fight the next monster!"
818,"The world is becomes more strange as we keep going?"
819,"You think so?"
820,"You seem to feel nothing about it. Maybe because yours is also a strange existence."
821,"Sheesh, that should about does it for these guys."
822,"I believe so."
823,"That's all you have to say? Looks like you're broken as well!"
824,"Monsters huh? I can defeat them all."
825,"There are more ahead."
826,"Got it, looks like we've gotta keep on going, doesn't it?"
827,"Ha, if these guys are as tough as they look, maybe they can serve as well."
828,"Can you manipulate the monsters?"
829,"Well, I won't know until I remember how to do it."
830,"So tell me, how long do I have to keep doing these boring monster fights?"
831,"Keep going forward, that is all."
832,"So a doll has no thought of its own? Easy for you to just take orders from others."
833,"Can't believe I have to fight this..."
834,"It seems like there are many monsters in this world."
835,"Let's rest here for today and figure out a strategy for them."
836,"All right, let's rest a while."
837,"The next mission awaits us."
838,"Now hold on, even for something like us need rests, just like humans."
839,"All right, I've taken care of the troubles."
840,"Not yet, there's more ahead."
841,"I'll cut down anything that stands in our way. Let's move!"
842,"Thou are not worthy to be thy opponent."
843,"There are stronger monsters ahead."
844,"I shall destroy anything that stand in my way."
845,"These guys are nothing to me."
846,"The next enemy will be harder to fight."
847,"Perfect, that is exactly what I am looking for, an opponent worthy of my efforts."
848,"Hmm, that was a close fight."
849,"They'll keep coming."
850,"No future for us if we don't fight, right?"
851,"Fighting these is meaningless. I have more important matters to attend to."
852,"For now, we can only go forward."
853,"You keep saying the same thing, but it looks like there's no other way except to go forward..."
854,"These monsters are no match for an Armor Hunter."
855,"They get more dangerous as we go forward."
856,"As long as we observe our enemies carefully, everything will be all right. Let's move on."
857,"Sylph, Ms. Doll, are you all right?"
858,"I'm fine."
859,"Yeah? Well okay then. Are there going to be more of these things? Looks like we've gotta be more careful."
860,"My strengths and skills, they are recovering! Although only for a bit..."
861,"The monsters will become stronger as we go on."
862,"I wonder if I'll get everything back if we keep going forward."
863,"Tsk tsk, this isn't in my job description!"
864,"Guess we can only go forward."
865,"What am I supposed to do in a place where I don't belong?"
866,"Hrmf, a monster after all. How dull."
867,"Let's keep moving."
868,"There's time left, why not enjoy the world a bit more?"
869,"I have defeated the monsters as you have requested, my lady."
870,"We better keep moving; there are still lots of enemies ahead."
871,"You have a way of ordering people, my lady."
872,"All right then, can you tell me why I am here?"
873,"For now, we can only go forward."
874,"Hmm, so this means I've gotta find the answers on my own?"
875,"Is there no more worthy opponents?"
876,"Let's go to the next location."
877,"Heh heh heh. What an interesting doll. Let me enjoy this world a little bit more."
878,"It's my first time fighting a monster like this. Is there going to be more?"
879,"There will be more if we keep going."
880,"It's getting fun now, just like a game!"
881,"Whew, it finally went down."
882,"The road ahead is still long."
883,"Fighting is not my expertise! Can someone help me please... I guess not. Sign~"
884,"How much more of this trash do I have to kill?"
885,"There will be more to fight."
886,"I see. Let's make this quick, then."
887,"Don't ever stand in my way again, demons!"
888,"Are you all right?"
889,"... ... I am fine, just a little headache."
890,"Are you hurt?"
891,"I am fine."
892,"Let me know if you're feeling unwell."
893,"Even for something like us, pushing it too far is not advised."
894,"Monsters huh? Feels like I have fought them before..."
895,"Can you recall anything?"
896,"No, I don't. But it feels more human-like..."
897,"Have you been injured?"
898,"No, I am fine."
899,"Then let's keep moving. There's still long way ahead."
900,"As the agent of God, these monsters are no match for me."
901,"There will be stronger monsters ahead."
902,"This trial is God's will too. I will not fail."
903,"Are there no more opponents for me to enjoy?"
904,"There will be stronger monsters ahead."
905,"Is that so? You better not let me down, then."
906,"That was fun, but something feels amiss..."
907,"There will be stronger monsters ahead."
908,"Don't let me down then, machine head."
909,"So this... is a monster... and this... is battle."
910,"That's right. You must defeat all monsters."
911,"What awaits us after this battle?"
912,"Will there be more monsters like this ahead?"
913,"Yes, and they will become stronger."
914,"I don't care how many show up; they will just be testing materials for my weapons. Keep them coming!"
915,"As long as we're fighting monsters like these, we'll have an easy time."
916,"What do you mean?"
917,"Things would get complicated if we're dealing with people. You know, who's behind them and whatnot..."
918,"Did not think we have to fight monsters..."
919,"Have you not seen one before?"
920,"Well, I don't know if I have seen one before. Could be that I just don't remember."
921,"They look nothing like my drawings."
922,"Are you scared?"
923,"If I were, I wouldn't be here right now. Although I think escaping is pointless too."
924,"Whatever your expectations are, if we're defeated, everything is over."
925,"Is that so?"
926,"No matter what types of battle, if we can't keep winning, everything is meaningless."
927,"You can even manipulate the dead? What a frightening woman you are."
928,"Are you scared?"
929,"Of course not. I just don't feel like taking orders even in death."
930,"A sorceress who can summon the deceased...?"
931,"Yes?"
932,"It's... memories... something deep inside was stirred up."
933,"I don't care if it's the dead or vampires, they mean nothing to me."
934,"Looks like it."
935,"God or monsters, anything that blocks my way shall fall under my blade."
936,"Forced into working even in death... how pathetic."
937,"Why is that?"
938,"They surely have worked hard while alive. Why not give them the peace and quiet they deserve after death?"
939,"Ah, the vampire. Are satisfy with the dead around you?"
940,"I don't know."
941,"Maybe she is waiting because she feels she can meet her kind here."
942,"Do vampires cause the nights?"
943,"The sun is up."
944,"Monsters that control the darkness and the dead. What will this place become if I haven't defeat them?"
945,"Even for someone as charming as you are, I can't go out with a vampire!"
946,"Do you dislike monsters?"
947,"Well, hahaha, I guess I am fine with it if they are charming."
948,"The vampires have been destroyed."
949,"......"
950,"Look, it's the sun..."
951,"Feels like a long time since we have seen the sun."
952,"The vampires have turned to ashes!"
953,"The light rays purified even the monsters that control the dead. I guess all evil things should be eliminated after all."
954,"The vampire can even control the dead? Oh boy, this will be tricky..."
955,"But you defeated her after all."
956,"Once daylight breaks, the vampires are all finished. It's not easy being a human and monster who, unlike us, will die eventually."
957,"What a horrible vampire."
958,"Is that so?"
959,"Aren't you scared? It can even revive the dead!"
960,"So, a vampire that controls the dead. Fighting something other than human is a good way to test my strength too."
961,"Is strength this important to you?"
962,"For man like me, strength is important, even if there's not purpose for it."
963,"Fighting this much undead is difficult, even for a man like me."
964,"Well done."
965,"The lead vampire has turned to ash. I guess it can do no more harm anymore."
966,"Now that's a fun monster to fight!"
967,"Let's keep going."
968,"No need to hurry. I am starting to understand why I am here."
969,"I wonder what's her motive for controlling dead humans?"
970,"I don't know."
971,"To me, humans are weak, whether they are living or not."
972,"Daylight has come to chase away the darkness."
973,"Probably because the vampires have been defeated."
974,"So the darkness will continue if we haven't defeat the vampires?"
975,"The smell of death is so alluring and fascinating, even for a vampire."
976,"Is that why they control the undead?"
977,"I guess you keep them by your side if you like them so much. If they can abide to your bidding, that's even better!"
978,"I see, a monster that controls the undead... this should be interesting."
979,"Is there something you know?"
980,"Hrmf, even if I tell you, you won't understand anyway. However, we may have underestimated the potential of Chaosium."
981,"And it's the same in this world too..."
982,"Vampire that controls the undead... brings back bad memories."
983,"Those are your memories."
984,"My comrades and enemies, they were once like this before. It was a horrible, sacrilegious war to the dead..."
985,"Once the vampire turns to ash, it can no longer revive."
986,"All will return to dusts."
987,"Even for us who can be fixed, once we're dust everything's over."
988,"Be gone with the vile beasts, you monster!"
989,"The sun came up."
990,"Looks like the sunlight is the only thing that is the same as my world. Alright, let's move."
991,"You fool! You dare cast the undead against me?"
992,"I wonder what did the vampire wants?"
993,"She probably thought dominating the night equals greatness. How laughable."
994,"The vampire has turned to ashes."
995,"And so are her undead minions."
996,"It's a mercy for soul less dead to turn to ashes."
997,"What a tough enemy. This should take care of it."
998,"The sun is out now."
999,"Ah, the sunlight, how nostalgic. But it's nothing more than blinding light to me now."
1000,"A living dead and mechanical doll... I seem to remember something now..."
1001,"Are you all right?"
1002,"I am fine, just need a breather. Perhaps going forward like this will lead me to the key of my memories."
1003,"Eesh, fighting the undead is disgusting."
1004,"The vampire and the undead have all turned to ashes."
1005,"All have turned to ashes... will my nightmares end as well?"
1006,"Manipulating the dead and night? All of this is unnatural!"
1007,"It ends with the destruction of the vampire."
1008,"All will restore to normal now, am I right Sylph?"
1009,"Even the monster is no match for my skills."
1010,"The vampire has turned to ashes."
1011,"One would only perish without strength... That is the truth."
1012,"Tsk tsk tsk, now we're fighting vampires? I am not a fan of horror stories!"
1013,"Are you scared of them?"
1014,"You damn right I am! I am just a normal detective!"
1015,"The proud undead vampire will perish into nothingness after all..."
1016,"Everything in the world must return to nothingness after all."
1017,"And that's what we are fighting against, even if I have to sacrifice everything."
1018,"Damn, that was a tough fight. Are you hurt my lady?"
1019,"I'm fine. What about you, Rood?"
1020,"I'm fine as well. And as you can see, my whip is in good condition."
1021,"Well, that was an exciting fight for an old man like me. I'm glad we won."
1022,"The sun has come up."
1023,"What a lovely morning. A new beginning always makes me happy."
1024,"The vampire has fallen into ashes. What do you think death feels like?"
1025,"I have no idea."
1026,"Ha ha ha, I thought so too, asking a doll what it's like to be dead."
1027,"The evil vampire has been defeated! Looks like peace will finally descend to this land."
1028,"Peace?"
1029,"Umm. The undead were redeemed as well, and peace will surely come."
1030,"Day breaks once the vampire is defeated... what in the world is happening here?"
1031,"I guess that means the vampire was controlling the night?"
1032,"So she was using some contraption to hide the night? Fascinating."
1033,"What a horrible woman. Not my cup of tea."
1034,"The vampire has turned to ashes."
1035,"Save us the trouble of getting rid of bodies..."
1036,"Dawn... So bright..."
1037,"The undead have vanished too."
1038,"Day light purifies and cleanses the manipulation of darkness..."
1039,"So the vampire can even control the nights..."
1040,"Once they are gone, mornings have returned too."
1041,"The dead returns to the earth, and the law of nature resumes."
1042,"The master of the nights has been destroyed."
1043,"And so do all the undead."
1044,"They sleep forever in the morning."
1045,"Is it curing them if we revive the dead?"
1046,"Can the dead be cured too?"
1047,"At least not with my power. That vampire lady was impressive."
1048,"The evil vampire and the eternal darkness have vanished. This must be the graciousness from God."
1049,"The sun has arisen."
1050,"The lights have returned! This is a blessing from God to my power!"
1051,"Once the sun came up, everything vanishes. Their existence is so weak."
1052,"The sun is so bright."
1053,"A vampire who cannot best the sun dares to challenge me?"
1054,"That woman... She was so naive, even with her esthetics."
1055,"Esthetics?"
1056,"Yes, it is something endearing to me, a key concept that that differentiates me from normal machines."
1057,"The night has left, and the rule of the vampire has ended."
1058,"The vampire and the undead are all gone now."
1059,"I guess the dead will finally find peace now."
1060,"Pity we have to do this. I hope there's some data left of the vampires."
1061,"Do you want to become a vampire too?"
1062,"Nah, I am only interested in the technology to bring back the dead."
1063,"Once the vampire is gone, they vanish as well."
1064,"So why revive the dead?"
1065,"Sometimes people are afraid when they are alone. I guess the vampire is like that too."
1066,"After the vampire was destroyed, the undead returned to earth once more. How envious I am of them."
1067,"Envious? What do you mean."
1068,"They no longer will taste pain again, unlike me."
1069,"The slaves that served their master vanish with their master. It's the unwavering rule."
1070,"So the vampire is so desperate for companions, even if they are undead?"
1071,"Things with free will can't be kept by oneself... how pathetic."
1072,"No matter how dedicated once were, everything lose their values now."
1073,"I wonder what the reasons are for collecting so many."
1074,"Reasons? Reasons only exist for those whose treasures were taken away from the dragon."
1075,"All the treasures have burned to ashes... so much for this guy's efforts."
1076,"What is the true wish of a dragon?"
1077,"Who knows. I guess even a monster like that needs an objective in life."
1078,"The dragon's live burns together with the rest of the treasures."
1079,"How pitiful."
1080,"Death and destructions are light; only the end grants value to anything."
1081,"The treasures perished with the dragon together."
1082,"I wonder if the dragon has felt happiness before too?"
1083,"Who knows? I guess he needs a reason to fight for."
1084,"Why collect this much treasure? What for?"
1085,"I wonder why too."
1086,"Once turned to ashes, everything's the same; thoughts and desires all vanish together as well."
1087,"The beautiful treasures turned to ash together with the dragon."
1088,"Why does a dragon covet treasures this much?"
1089,"Maybe because it just wants it? Maybe the desire for things is the only thing to live for."
1090,"I wonder if the dragon wishes to disappear with the treasures from this world."
1091,"What do you mean?"
1092,"All our efforts may end up pointless in the end. I guess you wouldn't understand."
1093,"It seems you can't keep both the treasures and your life."
1094,"So why did the dragon collect the treasures in the first place?"
1095,"Who knows? Not everyone leaves something in his or her life, even for a dragon."
1096,"The dragon and the treasures both turned to ashes!"
1097,"... ..."
1098,"I guess that's it then."
1099,"Foolish dragon, leaving nothing after death."
1100,"The treasures have all turned to ashes."
1101,"Looks like he was consumed by his greed... I guess for a dragon this is the only way to live."
1102,"Tsk tsk tsk, everything is burning!"
1103,"And I thought they were so pretty."
1104,"Things stay beautiful if not destroyed, and that goes the same for us too!"
1105,"Seems like everything is burning."
1106,"What a shame, the treasures were so beautiful."
1107,"This is just karma at play. Maybe it's for the best for the treasure that incites greed to be gone as well."
1108,"Dragon, huh... we had dealings in the past too."
1109,"You remembered something?"
1110,"A bit, but not all of it. I will find them all in time."
1111,"What a strong opponent!"
1112,"Yes, but you won in the end."
1113,"Yeah. I guess this settles one of our past dealings as well."
1114,"Foolish dragon, perished by its own greed."
1115,"Greed?"
1116,"That's right. There were many with great power and intelligence but ultimately perished under their own greed."
1117,"Whoa whoa whoa, everything is burning! Shame, they were so pretty."
1118,"Why does a dragon collect these things?"
1119,"I know the feeling of happiness when you keep something beautiful by your side. However, I guess you can't understand what that feels like, can you?"
1120,"Maybe a dragon is lonely because its power is so great."
1121,"And that's why it collects treasures?"
1122,"Only something like treasures can stay quiet and not harm a dragon."
1123,"Is that why the dragon keeps collecting this stuff?"
1124,"Nothing is eternal anyway."
1125,"But that's what the dragon wants."
1126,"Eternity is a lie. As long as you live, death will inevitably come. Yet why did it not see this coming?"
1127,"Collecting treasures through one's life... what a boring life it was."
1128,"And what is not a boring life?"
1129,"The questions itself is boring."
1130,"Exploring the world and expands one's knowledge... such is the nature of all intelligent creatures. Anything else is meaningless."
1131,"Collecting all these treasures, what good did it bring in the end?"
1132,"I guess that's everything for a dragon."
1133,"Even though I understand the desire to collect beautiful items."
1134,"What I don't understand is the desire behind surrounded by treasures, even if you have to loot from others."
1135,"Oh, what a waste, there were so many beautiful stuff!"
1136,"And now everything is burned up."
1137,"What's the point of collecting these treasures? Did it think itself as immortal?"
1138,"Such a fitting, miserable end for this pretentious monster"
1139,"What does a dragon need treasures for?"
1140,"The treasures are the symbol of the dragon's arrogance. He must have thought that's what befits him."
1141,"All it took was an instant for something that was once so beautiful to turn into dusts."
1142,"Maybe the dragon simply wanted to hoard it all by himself."
1143,"What you called [value] only matters when there is others around... The dragon does not seem to understand this."
1144,"We finally defeated it!"
1145,"Have you fought him before?"
1146,"I suddenly recalled during the last battle. Now I finally feel free."
1147,"A dragon huh? Never thought I would meet one here."
1148,"Something that happened before?"
1149,"It wasn't too long ago for myself, but I can't say for the rest of our battle companions."
1150,"How meaningless, everything turns to dust and ruins."
1151,"So why does a dragon want treasures?"
1152,"It is difficult to live aimlessly, or to have no one understand your reason for living."
1153,"Destruction driven by greed?"
1154,"I wonder if the dragon is satisfied."
1155,"It is because of this unquenchable lust that the dragon keeps hoarding treasures, even if costing countless lives of others."
1156,"No destiny and no goals. Can one truly live forever."
1157,"Maybe that's why the dragon collects treasures."
1158,"I do not condone robbing from others, even if for survival."
1159,"What a miserable way to die, not very suited for a dragon."
1160,"Is this what the dragon wishes for?"
1161,"Just an example of desire and greed overpowering strength. Only through determination does one's strength rises."
1162,"Tsk tsk, I doubt stories of detectives fighting dragon will sell well..."
1163,"All has turned to ashes."
1164,"If it were me, I would value life more than treasures, as a specie is defined by vitality."
1165,"A dragon also pursues all things beautiful and eternal."
1166,"But all that's left now are charred remains."
1167,"Perhaps, but I think the consciousness of the dragon must have been imprinted somewhere in the world, forever."
1168,"That was a tough enemy, even for a beast tamer such as myself."
1169,"Why does a dragon covets this much treasures?"
1170,"Treasures are simply objects and cannot compare to the transient beauty of flowers."
1171,"I've never imagined I would be able to fight the legendary dragon. What a formidable enemy."
1172,"Why does it crave the treasures?"
1173,"Perhaps if I can communicate with it, I can understand what a dragon, or any monsters, truly thinks."
1174,"Look at these beautiful treasures, all burned to ashes. What were its true intentions?"
1175,"I think it simply wanted to live on."
1176,"Things inevitably perish, no matter how beautiful or strong they are. This world is both so meaningless and strange."
1177,"So many treasures. What does a dragon need them for?"
1178,"I wonder the dragon feels content now."
1179,"I do not, and will not, understand the reason behind taking something so important away from innocent people."
1180,"I wonder how it took the dragon to collect this much treasure."
1181,"But then, everything has burned away."
1182,"It doesn't matter how long you spend on it; once you're dead, everything's gone forever."
1183,"Sad as it was, we are not that different"
1184,"Whew, never thought I'd have to fight a dragon. Makes for one hell of a story, though."
1185,"Why does it want to collect treasures?"
1186,"Like I know. Too much greed will only make you look silly."
1187,"Poor dragon... I heard its cry..."
1188,"Is the dragon sad?"
1189,"The loss of all those beautiful treasures and one's life... If that's not sadness, I don't know what else is."
1190,"I guess the dragon is not satisfied even with this much treasures."
1191,"I wonder what makes the dragon want to collect this much treasures."
1192,"Greed can be unfathomable, and perhaps the dragon has succumbed to its insatiable greed without knowing it."
1193,"Dragon, treasures, all gone. Maybe it's for the best they are."
1194,"I wonder if the victims of the treasures have found salvation."
1195,"Who knows? Maybe they resent that their chance for revenge was taken away by strangers."
1196,"Well, the dragon can do more bad things now."
1197,"Does grudge begets salvation too?"
1198,"Let me know if you're feeling unwell, I can cure you."
1199,"The God has punished the greedy dragon. Now everything can be purified."
1200,"What drives the dragon behind all its greed for treasures?"
1201,"Sins occur all the time and it's up to us the Agents of God's will to rectify them."
1202,"Dragon, treasures, everything's the same once you are burned"
1203,"What does it take to satisfy a dragon?"
1204,"I think greed cannot by satisfied; they will just grow indefinitely."
1205,"Pity, it's not every day you come across a dragon!"
1206,"What does it want really?"
1207,"The will to pursue beauty is more precious than everything. It's the determination that keeps the dragon existence."
1208,"A pity that the strength is a bit lacking."
1209,"Taking something valuable does not increase one's value."
1210,"You mean the dragon wants the recognition of others?"
1211,"If it means robbing treasures from others, then it is pathetic."
1212,"The dragon already has something far more valuable than all the treasures."
1213,"You mean the value of the dragon itself?"
1214,"That's right. The dragon already has awesome power, and does not need to covet things like treasures."
1215,"Did everything burn up?"
1216,"The dragon stayed with its treasures to the end."
1217,"After all, it's the only thing it can relate to. The dragon must have died contently with them."
1218,"Eternity in the name of treasures?"
1219,"What does it want treasures so badly?"
1220,"I guess it wants something eternal by its side, since it cannot be like that."
1221,"No matter how beautiful things were, they are all the same when turned to ash."
1222,"So, does the dragon felt happiness surrounded by treasures?"
1223,"Living in doubts and fear of others taking back the treasures... I don't think that's happiness at all."
1224,"Is the Goddess gone?"
1225,"What should I do now?"
1226,"Live on for the sake of yourself. That is the meaning of being alive."
1227,"Are you ok?"
1228,"I am fine. But what should I do from now?"
1229,"I am glad you have returned to normal again. Well then, what should we do from now?"
1230,"It seems the monster disguising as the Goddess has disappeared"
1231,"Now that the one who guides us is gone, what should we do now?"
1232,"I'll go to wherever you wanted to go, Ms. Doll."
1233,"To go so far as resurrection just to revenge... are you all right?"
1234,"I am fine now."
1235,"Very well, then. It seems the battle will continue. Come with me then."
1236,"Looks like you have returned to normal. And to think that the Goddess used us just for revenge..."
1237,"That's right, but she's gone now."
1238,"Well, if it can get me back to the surface, then I guess I am fine with it. I still got things to take care of."
1239,"The thoughts of the Goddess have disappeared, incinerated like fire."
1240,"Why have I stayed behind"
1241,"I do not know, but perhaps we can find the answer if we continue."
1242,"So this is the Goddess that has summoned me... but she is here no more."
1243,"You are in control of your own fate too."
1244,"Yes, you are right. I shall return to change my fate once again."
1245,"Are you all right? I have no idea things will turn out like this."
1246,"Yeah... but what should I do from now?"
1247,"Don't worry, things will turn out alright by themselves. I have also recalled something that I've gotta do. It all begins now."
1248,"This is the end, then."
1249,"......"
1250,"... I understand. I will follow you."
1251,"Revenge...?"
1252,"Do you want to return to the surface?"
1253,"Yes, I do, I need to go back and search for my reasons for existence."
1254,"What makes us different from that thing?"
1255,"The will for vengeance, you say?"
1256,"Revenge... Perhaps it is a very strong thought, that the will to complete it could even create worlds."
1257,"The Goddess of Fire... you are also a sad existence."
1258,"But she's disappeared from my body now."
1259,"That's great! We can go onto new journeys now."
1260,"The grudge has disappeared. How do you feel?"
1261,"I am fine, just wondering what should I do from now?"
1262,"You can always think about that later; for now it seems the way shown to us points back up to the surface."
1263,"Hey, are you ok?"
1264,"I am fine. She has completely disappeared."
1265,"That's good, then! I was so worried about you. We can finally be free now."
1266,"To go so far just to get her revenge... I kind of admire that woman now."
1267,"What should I do now?"
1268,"We'll think about it once we return to the surface. I also recalled why I must go back."
1269,"Damn that Goddess of Fire for making this happen!"
1270,"Nevertheless, she is gone now."
1271,"And you survived too. Looks like I am going to be stuck with you for a little longer."
1272,"The Goddess of Fire... she seems familiar to me."
1273,"Do you know her?"
1274,"I don't know. But I felt a trace of warmth and sadness..."
1275,"The Goddess wishes for death of everything, just like me."
1276,"But you stopped her."
1277,"I'd rather enjoy death brought forth by myself and not from others' tampering."
1278,"The grudge of vengeance... How pointless."
1279,"What will I do from now?"
1280,"I'll figure out that myself. I am, however, starting to be interested in you now."
1281,"Even the Goddess has her pride and faith to uphold to."
1282,"However, also those behaviors will lead chaos to the world."
1283,"If stopping the Goddess is for the sake of peace, then I think I am doing the right thing."
1284,"You must have inherited the soul of Lady Yami"
1285,"The Soul of the Goddess?"
1286,"Correct. Now that all enmity has been purified, you exist as a brand new being."
1287,"Well well, looks like the farce has ended..."
1288,"To think it would turn out like this..."
1289,"At least everything's ended... Whatever, guess it's time to go back to my old work."
1290,"The children's game has ended."
1291,"Maybe the Lady Goddess wishes to change this world."
1292,"Insanity created by machines... what an impressive invention by that guy..."
1293,"A grudge, huh? At least it got me back."
1294,"Are you going back to the surface."
1295,"That's right. I shall go back and find where I truly belong."
1296,"Seems like this is the end now. Are you okay?"
1297,"Yeah... but what should I do from now?"
1298,"I have somewhere that I must go back to. That's where I must go."
1299,"Is this what Lady Yami want?"
1300,"I don't know, but her heart is pure."
1301,"I know that, it's just that..."
1302,"A goddess bound by vengeance and grudge?"
1303,"Looks like it has ended. What should I do now?"
1304,"In the name of justice, I am going back to the surface."
1305,"So the Goddess is named Yami... she's nothing more than a normal girl."
1306,"Does the divine beast recognize who she really is?"
1307,"Yeah... they were good friends who used to live together, just like with me..."
1308,"... I am really sorry to make you fight with a friend, Sylph"
1309,"Looks like this is the final stop of this world."
1310,"Yes, it is..."
1311,"To you it may be the final stop, but not for me. I have matters I must attend to on the surface."
1312,"At last, everything has ended. That was some outrageous experience we've gone through. Are you all right?"
1313,"Umm, but I don't know what I am supposed to do now."
1314,"And that's the beauty of freedom: do whatever you like. I am going back to my old job too."
1315,"The Goddess has left this place. Are you staying here?"
1316,"I don't know."
1317,"Well then, come with me. In a world without end, I have suddenly wanted to live on with a machine... like you."
1318,"Ohhh, the thoughts of the Goddess, Lady Yami have disappeared..."
1319,"I think we still have matters to take care of..."
1320,"If you say so. I hope Lady Yami's thought is still around somewhere..."
1321,"So this is the final battle, seems so long and yet so short."
1322,"What should we do from now?"
1323,"I am going back to where I belong. Don't worry; you must have somewhere you are needed too."
1324,"A crazy woman in this crazy world. Maybe the Goddess is that most normal being in this world."
1325,"But you defeated her for me."
1326,"Hahaha, that's because I LOVE chaos, so I must destroy everything! Hahahahaha..."
1327,"I've defeated the Goddess with grudges! Have I saved the world?"
1328,"I do not know, but you saved me."
1329,"I am glad you are all right. Come on; let's go back to my home! You are greatly welcome to stay with me."
1330,"So the Goddess is bent on revenge against the world, even at the cost of sacrificing others?"
1331,"Maybe, but she's gone too."
1332,"I guess all that's left is returning to the surface. I wonder what has it become?"
1333,"After all that trouble and it ended like this? Some great master you got."
1334,"I am sorry, but at least you are free now."
1335,"Got me out of my boredom anyway. But from now on I am doing things my way."
1336,"If it weren't for the Goddess of Fire, I wouldn't be here..."
1337,"And I could not have obtained a heart too."
1338,"With her death on us, we must continue forward..."
1339,"Lady Yami has entrusted her thoughts to you."
1340,"Really?"
1341,"The fact that you remain here as you are is the answer."
1342,"The vengeance of the Goddess has ended, but mine has just begun."
1343,"Where do we go from here?"
1344,"I must return to the surface to bring an end to the cursed fate between me and her."
1345,"Look, look, I have fixed Lady Yami!"
1346,"What happened to the Goddess?"
1347,"I cured her sickness. Don't worry, I was by your side all this time too!"
1348,"By the God's will, my time will come after the Goddess is destroyed!"
1349,"So what will you do now?"
1350,"What do you think? I am going to unite everyone... the surface of the Multiworld... under the God's will!"
1351,"Living just for the sake of revenge. Won't she feel bored?"
1352,"To Lady Goddess, that's everything."
1353,"Well, that kind of life is not my cup of tea. At least I can return to the surface now. Why don't you come with me and let's have fun together back on the surface?"
1354,"So the Goddess is dead now?"
1355,"Yes, after she has relieved me."
1356,"I see. At least I get to enjoy this insane and yet beautiful realm."
1357,"I hope the power that created this world was shared to a machine like you."
1358,"Betting everything on the matters that are most important... The Goddess has reminded me of something I must do."
1359,"And what now for you?"
1360,"Going back to the surface. I have something that I must tell to that person."
1361,"The powerful grudge has bent all the rules, but there's no need to sacrifice this doll for this new discovery."
1362,"Why save me?"
1363,"I am interested in how your heart has formed, that's about it."
1364,"Hey, when we get back, help me with my report, all right?"
1365,"So the Goddess also has somewhere to return to, even if consumed by madness."
1366,"Not for me. What about you?"
1367,"Such thing was lost long ago. That's why I wanted to find it together with you."
1368,"The Goddess is gone, but I am spared. Seems like no matter I tired I just can't die."
1369,"What will you do now?"
1370,"Like you. As someone who can't die, I feel like living just a little longer. Why don't you come with me as well?"
1371,"Observation of the world made by the Goddess of Fire has concluded."
1372,"So the record of me, a creation of the Goddess, will disappear also?"
1373,"No, your record has just started."
1374,"I look forward to whichever record you will leave in this world."
1375,"The wheel of time has started turning. I must now find my way."
1376,"Is that what you really are? I am surprised you have fallen inhumanly this far."
1377,"A companion? What a nostalgic feeling, but it's not something I need now."
1378,"I am not interested in your ambitions, but what stands before my way shall fall!"
1379,"To save our world again, your strength is needed."
1380,"I am going to gather my companions again. Why don't you come as well?"
1381,"The last one standing is always the victor..."
1382,"Death is the only hope that blooms in this dark world."
1383,"Ah, eternal battle, just what I desired!"
1384,"Power is meant to destroy our enemies. It is the unwavering truth since the beginning of time."
1385,"I am the one who is above all. I shall imprint my name deep into your soul!"
1386,"You should be honored that it is I who will deliver you to your end."
1387,"Your power, why not use it to its fullest in my organization?"
1388,"This is only a game. What matters to me will come only after I have destroyed you."
1389,"Can't believe we'll meet like this again, eh Karenberg?"
1390,"Ah the beautiful Birgit, let see how far you have matured!"
1391,"The brave shadow swordsman. I crave your power now more than ever!"
1392,"Don't stare at me like that, immortal one. I am merely expressing my gratitude to you."
1393,"Looks like you got some fancy skills, little girl."
1394,"This time I shall destroy you all with the sound of this guitar!"
1395,"I am no longer interested in your Great World."
1396,"Get away from me! I have not fallen that far enough to accept your temptation!"
1397,"Don't estimate the power of the immortal!"
1398,"My strength is more than your match!"
1399,"I have no time for jokes from a doll..."
1400,"However, we can only go forward."
1401,"This hatred... I shall make whoever designed me pay!"
1402,"How dull... Filthy creatures with no sentience, is that all you got?"
1403,"There are monsters also with intelligence. Don't underestimate them."
1404,"Don't act like you know it all, doll, I am not dumb enough to be manipulated by monsters."
1405,"The power to control time... This is something I long for."
1406,"Is that so?"
1407,"Distort whatever is present and leave it like that forever."
1408,"This is something that is not yet possible in our world."
1409,"A symbol of fear like the dragon is nothing more than a fool if he's blinded and bound by desires."
1410,"So, are you saying we must not collect treasures?"
1411,"Just like strength, there are times when treasures are useful."
1412,"For those who ignore such occasions, treasures will only bring destruction."
1413,"Revenge against the world just for that? Arrogance has limit too, you know."
1414,"What should I do from now?"
1415,"Oh brave doll, you shall become my attendant."
1416,"Come back with me to the surface and let's take over this world together!"
1417,"I have forsaken my past..."
1418,"If you must stand in my way, then die!"
1419,"Let's end this here and now."
1420,"I have my ways to go."
1421,"I do not sympathize with you. That is your way of life."
1422,"You must have something that you can do."
1423,"Let's go a few rounds, Leon."
1424,"Sorry, I have no time for that."
1425,"Fine, I'll play with you."
1426,"Target confirmed. Proceeding to target termination."
1427,"I won't pray for something that doesn't know if it exist or not."
1428,"The sound of crunching bones and crushing guts is my gospel."
1429,"Sighing and screaming is the foundation of the Great World."
1430,"This is all for the sake of the Great World..."
1431,"Please forgive my rudeness, but will you be my opponent?"
1432,"It is the leader's duty to know his men's potential."
1433,"Who am I, and what's my mission?"
1434,"Keep going. I exist to guide you."
1435,"I see, then I shall do what you say."
1436,"Hearing the screams of the monsters has stirred up something inside me."
1437,"Now is not the time for sadness."
1438,"This trembling feeling of excitement deep in my body... is this really sadness?"
1439,"Looks like you can't control your own death, if you can manipulate others."
1440,"The sun rises as the vampire is defeated."
1441,"I love the morning where the undead scream as they are torched by the daylight."
1442,"Dragon, treasures, all are just dusts after they have been incinerated."
1443,"So why collect this much?"
1444,"Maybe he wants to hear the screams of the people whose treasures were stolen?"
1445,"So that's why he hoards so much?"
1446,"Your mission ends here."
1447,"What will you do now?"
1448,"I am going back to my original mission."
1449,"As comfortable as this world is, I have to return to the surface."
1450,"If it's death you want, then death you shall receive!"
1451,"All that returns to darkness shall disappear, even pain."
1452,"I write my own destiny."
1453,"From now on, I will be in charge."
1454,"Go easy, I got a sore leg."
1455,"I didn't know bugs could be used in battles too."
1456,"I need to brush up on things that affect humans."
1457,"You're welcome to be my patient."
1458,"It's nothing, just a minor bite."
1459,"Never thought I would get to observe C.C.'s machines up close."
1460,"I wonder how does Tyrrel's weapon work? Mind if you demo it for me?"
1461,"Show me how far the medical micro machines have advanced."
1462,"Darn it. I don't believe I have to fight Linnaeus under these circumstances."
1463,"Tsk Tsk, didn't know such a place existed."
1464,"Don't just sit there, keep going"
1465,"Don't rush me like that. There are many strange things here."
1466,"This is my first time fighting a monster."
1467,"There are more monsters ahead."
1468,"Yeah? Would be great if there were more insect-like monsters ahead, too."
1469,"You can manipulate things without micro machines? Impressive! I am envious now."
1470,"Frustrated?"
1471,"The results of years of my research so easily surpassed..."
1472,"Of course I am frustrated."
1473,"Shouldn't heroes and not engineers fight the dragon?"
1474,"But you succeeded anyway... say, what are you doing?"
1475,"Oh, just taking some samples from the dragon."
1476,"Don't mind if I take a little bit of blood, do you?"
1477,"Maybe the Goddess is the machine closest to humans."
1478,"Instilled with a real heart now, will I become as crazy as her?"
1479,"That's all up you. If you're worried about it, come with me then."
1480,"I'll assist you should insanity overtakes you."
1481,"Please get out my way, there's no need to die unnecessarily"
1482,"Although death is fine too, but not today."
1483,"Taste my death... so sweet and succulent..."
1484,"Kneel and beg me for mercy!"
1485,"I'm only interested in strong ones. Are you strong?"
1486,"The strong will always survive."
1487,"Even hatred feels like love when it becomes too much."
1488,"I've lost my honor as a warrior already."
1489,"The forest is no more. Everything can just be destroyed, then."
1490,"It's already too late, Ayn. Everything is."
1491,"What, you are here too? Too bad."
1492,"Are you going to make this world your plaything, too?"
1493,"Your hatred is......"
1494,"Why is Nadine here......!?"
1495,"Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha, you are here, too."
1496,"Where do you want to go, missy?"
1497,"It's very far ahead. I'll lead the way."
1498,"What you said is dubious, but you are the only one I can rely on now."
1499,"Daemons. It seems like I haven't fought with them for a long time."
1500,"Haven't you fought with daemons before?"
1501,"I don't remember it well so I don't know either. But if it is necessary, I'll think of it one day."
1502,"Are you calling yourself a Queen by forcing the dead to kneel down? You are so full of yourself."
1503,"Are you envying me?"
1504,"Are you kidding me? I am not interested in being served by the dead."
1505,"No matter how persistent you were before, it does not make sense, as long as everything goes to emptiness."
1506,"Will you be satisfied if you own a dragon for a certain period?"
1507,"No matter how eager you are, something is irreversible."
1508,"It may feel happy because it died without suffering such awful pain."
1509,"There is nothing more difficult than dealing with uncontrolled love."
1510,"But the Goddess who entrusted her will to me had gone."
1511,"Really? But she left something interesting instead."
1512,"Huh, I am looking forward to going back on the ground."
1513,"My shield is eternal."
1514,"Foolish one, know your weakness."
1515,"Come on, it's the beginning of a new show."
1516,"Taste my XXXX!"
1517,"As expected, I am dazzling during battle!"
1518,"Want to try me?"
1519,"Whether you flee or get defeated, your destiny will be either!"
1520,"I am not going to lose him!"
1521,"I am so excited right now and I have not had such a feeling for many years! Leave it to me!"
1522,"I will definitely beat you today!"
1523,"Hey you, have we met somewhere before?"
1524,"You've changed a lot from before you disappeared."
1525,"Oh oh! Give me all you got!"
1526,"Do you think your swordsmanship is better than mine?"
1527,"......?"
1528,"You are still calm as before."
1529,"You are still the same and only talk glibly."
1530,"We're finally out of the forest. Just go straight ahead, right?"
1531,"Yeah. Let's go."
1532,"No problem. Leave it to me!"
1533,"What's wrong? Why do the daemons here not have a backbone!"
1534,"That's because you are so lucky."
1535,"What did you say? This is my power!"
1536,"Ha ha ha ha!"
1537,"If she were not a monster, I hope she could be my girlfriend."
1538,"Is a vampire unsuitable?"
1539,"Although so beautiful, I don't think I can get along with a sister who is capable of manipulating the dead."
1540,"I had avenged you, everyone......"
1541,"Have you ever fought with it?"
1542,"Ah, our partners were almost all killed by that guy."
1543,"But I finally have the audacity to face everyone."
1544,"I was just worried about what will happen for a short while. Are you OK?"
1545,"Why did you save me? I'm one of the items belonging to the Goddess."
1546,"We've just travelled together here."
1547,"If I left an old friend in the lurch, it is impossible for me to get back to the ground."
1548,"I will not put the future in the hands of evil."
1549,"My sacrifice is insignificant for correcting this world."
1550,"Don't stand in my way; the crisis is imminent."
1551,"My sword is eternal."
1552,"I'm Hungry."
1553,"Whoa, what the heck is this?"
1554,"Hmm... this is troublesome."
1555,"I'm greater than a lion."
1556,"You insolent punk; I shall crush you."
1557,"How long has it been since we dueled like this?"
1558,"Whatcha standing around for? You're the only one what can save that one."
1559,"Which is stronger? Your whip or my power?"
1560,"Who is stronger? You or me?"
1561,"Oh? You want to fight also?"
1562,"Hey, who are you actually? I feel like I've seen you before."
1563,"We haven't had a showdown in a long time. I'll not make it easy for you."
1564,"Do you also know who I am?"
1565,"The beast versus the beast master, now... now, this should be quite a show."
1566,"Orang, I never thought there'd be a day to fight you."
1567,"Sure, this is the first time to fight you like this."
1568,"Mr. Cute Puppet, let's play."
1569,"Am I required to go to the Goddess?"
1570,"Yes, the Goddess said she also wished you could retrieve your memories."
1571,"Her words are absolute, and so I shall be obedient."
1572,"Hungry..."
1573,"Can a machine be hungry?"
1574,"Because I am great, I am different from others."
1575,"It would be very boring if I could not eat or nap."
1576,"Dying is boring, is it?"
1577,"That is hard to say. It may be a blessing to become like us."
1578,"I'm so good, even dragons are completely unworthy opponents."
1579,"Bears, now this kind of animals are quite something."
1580,"It's because I am quite something, not bears overall."
1581,"Lady Mia is so very gentle, reaching out to a piece of scrap metal like me."
1582,"Please don't cry. I shall be with the Goddess."
1583,"I'm sorry; I'm sorry Lady Mia... Please forgive me..."
1584,"Correcting the world is my mission."
1585,"Need not heed the words of a sinner."
1586,"Leave, or be destroyed."
1587,"Destruction may be unavoidable in order for restoration to take place."
1588,"Let chaos be stopped."
1589,"Stacia, I will punish you!"
1590,"There's no need for an observer; the world is such a one already."
1591,"Ha, you actually pursued all the way here, such an effort."
1592,"No one can impose judgments on right or wrong, and your actions tell of your self-righteousness."
1593,"There's nothing more dangerous than a contradicting self-consciousness. Are you still going to proceed even if it is so?"
1594,"Your memories will come back to you in time."
1595,"Seems like there's nothing more to be said. Alright, you lead."
1596,"I still remember how to fight... I should be alright at this level."
1597,"The monsters will only get stronger from here."
1598,"I will not get careless. As long as everything is returned to the light."
1599,"The dead are once again how they should be, correcting the twisted end."
1600,"What is death truly? Is it something fearsome?"
1601,"Who knows? If the emotions of facing death could be known,"
1602,"maybe one day it will be known as well."
1603,"Is everything dust to dust? What is the true intention of the dragon?"
1604,"The dragon may only be trying to survive."
1605,"If the obsession to live yields such a result, then what a meaningless tale this is."
1606,"Destroying that woman here was a pure fluke."
1607,"What is your relationship with the Goddess?"
1608,"The Goddess all of you worship is only one of the sinners I am here to punish."
1609,"Nothing more."
1610,"I shall not back down from any enemy."
1611,"The world relies on us!"
1612,"Let me take everything back to the cold void."
1613,"All shall die, so now, die."
1614,"...Exterminate..."
1615,"Back then and now... are all just orders and obedience?"
1616,"Commence operation..."
1617,"As long as I fight here, I could go back one day?"
1618,"I only know how to kill, monsters or otherwise."
1619,"This fighting style...seems familiar..."
1620,"Come on, Riesz. Let's fight."
1621,"Squad Leader Milian, are we doing the right thing?"
1622,"Victory or death? Even in this world, you're still such a happy-go-lucky guy."
1623,"Looks like you learned some interesting moves. Now watch me break them all."
1624,"Ideriha, glad to see you're still the same old you. Now let's have a showdown."
1625,"What a curious world. Is proceeding forward all there is to it?"
1626,"You fight, I lead."
1627,"Okay...I'll follow your lead since you say so."
1628,"I remember I used to make a living by killing these creatures."
1629,"Have you seen a monster before?"
1630,"Yes, it's coming back to me now, as well as who I was."
1631,"It's morning? When the blessings of the sun return, everything here will be alright."
1632,"It won't be for the night?"
1633,"Night would grant a restful peace."
1634,"Both are necessities to survive."
1635,"Don't know due to what cause and causality, it ended up with me defeating him."
1636,"Do you know of this dragon?"
1637,"I heard our comrades were slaughtered by him"
1638,"Defeating him here should let them rest in peace..."
1639,"We are the same, used by the Goddess...How unacceptable this is."
1640,"But, I have earned something on this journey."
1641,"I can also return up above."
1642,"It's not a bad thing, come to think of it."
1643,"Geez, how irritating..."
1644,"I shall smash you all..."
1645,"Cannot feel a thing, how annoying..."
1646,"You too are a sinner? Then die."
1647,"All of you are wrong, so all of you will be destroyed."
1648,"If I can defeat you, then I can..."
1649,"I am only doing some adjustments, not resisting."
1650,"Hahahahaha, why bluff, you puny chess piece."
1651,"Adjusting your body? Then I shall be your opponent."
1652,"Yo, puppet, why must I do such a thing?"
1653,"The only thing we can do is proceed forward."
1654,"I must be out of my mind to ask a puppet like you... what a bore..."
1655,"Is there nothing else to do other than endless battles no matter where we go?"
1656,"This is a necessary procedure to retrieve the memories."
1657,"Ceh, everyone's equally irritating."
1658,"The corpse is restored after the master is gone? Now I'm pissed."
1659,"Are you recalling some unpleasant past?"
1660,"Hush! Don't ask about a person's memory, you puppet."
1661,"It'd be meaningless to horde such treasures only to be killed."
1662,"Why did the dragon collect treasures?"
1663,"Probably just wanted to stare at something beautiful."
1664,"Though I'm not prepared to die for the mission, it sure seems like it's gonna be like that."
1665,"Then, why save me?"
1666,"Because if it wasn't for you, I could not recall my true calling."
1667,"Take it as a returning favor."
1668,"The monsters are defeated, yet the mark is still here."
1669,"I also do not know what should be done now."
1670,"Just keep going. It'd be meaningless if you deteriorated to total paralysis."
1671,"There's a beam of light. The culprit should be straight ahead."
1672,"Right, though we're running out of time."
1673,"The condition is deteriorating fast, we had better hurry."
1674,"Though the witch is eliminated, the key objects to break the curse are scattered all over."
1675,"Seems to be getting better."
1676,"Still, we cannot let our guards down. Let's go, ${AVATAR_NAME}."
1677,"The mark seems will not be disappearing."
1678,"So what should we do..."
1679,"It doesn't matter who did it; we shall cut down anyone standing in our path."
1680,"As long as we keep going, we shall find the guy who made you like this."
1681,"Yes... but my body is already..."
1682,"Worry not; there must be a way to cure you."
1683,"${AVATAR_NAME}, are you alright?"
1684,"The mark seems lighter now."
1685,"However, a full recovery requires all the scattered holy grails. They must be collected."
1686,"How do I make the mark disappear..."
1687,"I also don't know."
1688,"We can only keep proceeding forward in this area."
1689,"Looks like the reason for this commotion is straight ahead."
1690,"Should be, but if it continues..."
1691,"Hmm, your health condition is a concern. Let's hurry."
1692,"I was almost out of options; thankfully, the mark seems to have stopped spreading."
1693,"Yeah, it looks fine for now, but curing it completely..."
1694,"The Holy Grail fragments must be collected."
1695,"Come, let's go, ${AVATAR_NAME}."
1696,"Strange. Though it doesn't seem to be spreading."
1697,"However, there's no telling what will happen later."
1698,"We must get to the bottom of it, and cannot let it continue to deteriorate."
1699,"The culprit should be straight ahead. How's your condition?"
1700,"It's manageable for now, but if it continues..."
1701,"Looks like we have to hurry. Just hold on."
1702,"How are you doing, ${AVATAR_NAME}?"
1703,"It's much better, but still a long way from fine."
1704,"It's healing gradually. Seems like the holy grails are required."
1705,"This land must be explored further."
1706,"It's heartless to do such a thing to a child."
1707,"I can still move, but don't know for what reason."
1708,"The mark... if only it would stop spreading."
1709,"Sylph said, there's a similar scent to the mark coming from that way."
1710,"Okay. I'm not sure though."
1711,"Your body is becoming paralyzed isn't it? Let's hurry up."
1712,"Are you alright, ${AVATAR_NAME}?"
1713,"The mark seems to be lighter."
1714,"The Holy Grail fragments must be collected soon. Where would they be?"
1715,"You cannot fully cure that mark yourself?"
1716,"I don't know how it came to be, so I don't know how to..."
1717,"It'd be too late if things were to happen, so right now, just keep moving."
1718,"You're moving too slow, puppet."
1719,"Defeating the culprit ahead should help..."
1720,"The opponent seems to be skilled in battle. Only if there were an easy way to defeat the opponent."
1721,"Are you still not cured, ${AVATAR_NAME}?"
1722,"It would heal faster if there were Holy Grail fragments."
1723,"Fine, then I shall take it as a chance to refine my techniques."
1724,"What a strange mark. Does it affect your bodily functions?"
1725,"No, at least not yet."
1726,"Hmm... This must be resolved fast."
1727,"The culprit should be straight ahead. How's your condition?"
1728,"It's becoming hard to move... it wouldn't be long before..."
1729,"There is no delaying now; we have to hurry."
1730,"The culprit is defeated, but it seemed only to stop the curse from spreading."
1731,"It looks like the Holy Grail fragments must be collected."
1732,"However, the body is able to move gradually."
1733,"This land must be explored further."
1734,"Let's go, ${AVATAR_NAME}."
1735,"An explained mark is it? Does it hurt, or feel uncomfortable?"
1736,"No, not yet, but don't know how it will be in the future."
1737,"Then let's be on our way. Inform me immediately if you feel anything."
1738,"The culprit monster that made you like this is right ahead, just hold on for one more minute."
1739,"Is it really going to cure?"
1740,"Don't worry; it will be cured. That's why we kept on going."
1741,"The mark didn't disappear. Are you alright, ${AVATAR_NAME}?"
1742,"I can move my body, but I don't know when the mark will disappear."
1743,"It looks like the Holy Grail fragments must be collected."
1744,"Just hold on."
1745,"The mark seems really uncomfortable."
1746,"I think so too. There's no telling what will happen if we leave it alone."
1747,"The culprit must be found to prevent things from developing."
1748,"Is the culprit straight ahead?"
1749,"Seems like it... but my body is becoming..."
1750,"Looks like we have to hurry. If you became paralyzed, it would greatly trouble me."
1751,"Did the mark stop spreading, ${AVATAR_NAME}?"
1752,"Yes, but if it is to cure,"
1753,"The Holy Grail fragments must be collected."
1754,"It'd be good if it cures soon. Let's move."
1755,"I never thought we'd meet like this. This is kind of scary."
1756,"I didn't think you want to fight as well. However, there is something that I have to do."
1757,"Since we are said to be disasters, then, let us fight like disasters."
1758,"It doesn't matter what you are. To me, killing is all that matters."
1759,"I know what you mean. But, we also have something we have to do."
1760,"In order to save that child, I must defeat you."
1761,"Even if we are disasters to you!"
1762,"I have no interests in your philosophies. Get out of my way."
1763,"We have things we have to do, and conflicts are unavoidable."
1764,"Even if we are disasters, in order to retrieve my memories..."
1765,"Even if something were to happen to you, we still have things we need to do."
1766,"Your existence alone is a disaster to us!"
1767,"Let's go, if we leave the mark alone, there's no telling what would happen."
1768,"Let's go, before my whole body is paralyzed."
1769,"The mark has stopped spreading."
1770,"But the Holy Grail fragments are required for a full recovery."
1771,"Is power everything in a world without law and order?"
1772,"I miss the days when I was out on arrests."
1773,"It's all for a better world."
1774,"You seem to have strange powers, so show me!"
1775,"In order to realize our wishes, please stand out of our way."
1776,"The fate of failures is only being tossed away; be prepared!"
1777,"Seems to be over-educated."
1778,"You mean, this kind of entertainment is better than nothing, is it, Gustave?"
1779,"I believe in your powers. Hold nothing back; come on!"
1780,"There no need to follow your laws now."
1781,"Want to try me on for size? Not bad, pal."
1782,"I'll show you what I've got."
1783,"Didn't think of a day I would have to follow the order of a puppet."
1784,"Got a problem with that?"
1785,"No. We have to proceed, and I'll follow your lead."
1786,"I hate monsters."
1787,"Have you had some uncomfortable experiences with them?"
1788,"I'm really sensitive, and I don't like those who are not punishable by the law."
1789,"It's a vampire."
1790,"So, what about a vampire?"
1791,"Beauty, is a powerful weapon in itself."
1792,"Never mind, it's not something a puppet would understand."
1793,"Whoa, you actually collected these treasures?"
1794,"But it's all burned away."
1795,"All burned away isn't it, the sins and the self?"
1796,"It's the dragon's final struggle."
1797,"Dolls are expendable, and that man-shield became the Goddess' servant in the end. How horrible."
1798,"You mean the Goddess only treats us like chess pieces?"
1799,"If you think we'll quietly fall in line just because you do that,"
1800,"Then I'm sorry to say, you're just too naive."
1801,"I must fulfill my mission."
1802,"We only wish to know the true history."
1803,"When the wrongs have been right, all shall vanish, be it sorrow or pain."
1804,"What we ought to do now, is right the wrongs."
1805,"Let me put an end to this."
1806,"I wish you wouldn't have seen me in such state, General Waltz..."
1807,"Are you going to pry around me again?"
1808,"I guess you couldn't care less, even if I have ended up like this."
1809,"See for yourself, the end of humans that have fallen to the manipulation of your kind."
1810,"Lord Noichrome...We...we....."
1811,"Have you experienced thoughts so intense that consume like fire?"
1812,"Why...why have you also come to this world..."
1813,"You, could you really be the Queen?"
1814,"I see you've come to this world too. That's interesting."
1815,"You are free to do as you like; as long as the mission is left to me."
1816,"You really haven't changed a bit...troublesome woman as ever."
1817,"Is it all right for us to just proceed like this..."
1818,"We do not have the time to spare for hesitation."
1819,"It looks like my only choice to go with your lead."
1820,"If I keep fighting, one day will I remember everything?"
1821,"That's what I heard."
1822,"And when my memories come back, I wonder what we would become..."
1823,"So when the master disappears, the dead would return to their rest."
1824,"Have you fought with this vampire before?"
1825,"No..."
1826,"But somehow I felt as if I knew someone who could do things like this."
1827,"When the dragon has been defeated, it would have left its name in the history."
1828,"Would that satisfy the dragon?"
1829,"If the dragon yearns for eternity, leaving its name could very well be its wish."
1830,"I have punished the one who twisted Karma."
1831,"But here I remain. What should I do from now on?"
1832,"Well, take action to find your answer."
1833,"Together with us..."
1834,"You can't expect to win if you don't seize the initiative."
1835,"You have always been by my side. But..."
1836,"I think now I finally understood what was said at the time."
1837,"Everything has come to be because of my own choice. I have no regrets."
1838,"It looks like you found the answer you have been looking for."
1839,"Although someone has reminded me to get on with my life more seriously, I guess it doesn't matter much with the way things have turned out."
1840,"I think it would be easier if we just fight it out rather than deliberating things."
1841,"Saving the world? Achieving greatness? What good are these things if you are dead?"
1842,"I would gladly do that if I could pretend none of these things ever happened."
1843,"I would like to start my life anew too! Do not stand in my way!"
1844,"Have you seen it too, that world?"
1845,"I am betting on every bit of possibility here."
1846,"Catch up! How could we move on without you?"
1847,"It's you who has been going too fast; I can't keep up."
1848,"Sheesh! Let me carry you so we can move on!"
1849,"That was easy! Have the monsters here grown weak after enjoying peace for too long?"
1850,"Don't get careless; there are more powerful monsters ahead of us."
1851,"Not a problem; I'll just grow stronger along the way."
1852,"What a pretty gal; what you have done is such a shame."
1853,"That's a vampire we are talking about; aren't you afraid?"
1854,"I was a little scared, yes. But it wouldn't be bad if I could be a servant to a ravishing beauty like that."
1855,"Oh, I can't? That's a pity..."
1856,"I totally can relate to how the dragon must have felt."
1857,"Not me; I don't get it."
1858,"That rush of excitement and joy when you plunder treasure..."
1859,"It is an exquisite feeling that only the plunderer would understand"
1860,"The Holy Lady... perhaps she would have wanted to lead a new life if she could."
1861,"Life? Now that I've lost the Holy Lady, am I entitled to that privilege?"
1862,"If you want to find out, return with me to the world above and seek your answer!"
1863,"That is truly a great idea. So be it!"
1864,"It is an honor to have the privilege of dueling with the legendary ace."
1865,"I won't let me guard down, no matter how lucky you are."
1866,"I wonder if you bleed when wounded; let's find out."
1867,"I never thought I would have the chance to fight with the ace of the regiment."
1868,"You might be skilled with games; I wonder if you could fare as well in combat?"
1869,"So this is the imposing presence of the ace; but I will not lose!"
1870,"It's time to pay back once and for all for all the defeats I have suffered at your hands!"
1871,"Let's see how long you could keep up with your relaxed look, Guardian!"
1872,"Rob, don't pull any punches even if it's someone you know!"
1873,"You, you wouldn't happen to know Sprout, would you?"
1874,"Marguerite, your days of playing the bystander end now!"
1875,"Keep your cool, Bernhard; you won't stand a chance against me if you don't."
1876,"At least it beats babysitting those dolls, right? Grunwald"
1877,"This is also part of the game. Don't hold back; give your best shot."
1878,"So after traveling we fight to find out who's the best? That's not a bad idea."
1879,"As much as games are fun, it looks like combat is better suited for us."
1880,"Are you going to fight us with that sword you've used on monsters? Interesting."
1881,"I will use you to proof the power of this child. Here I come, Wilhelm!"
1882,"I should stand a chance to win if I could get rid of those headphones."
1883,"I have grown tired of your moves during the journey!"
1884,"I may be good in games; but I am just as good in battle!"
1885,"Your vast power is frightening. But..."
1886,"Forget your fear; it is what you have to do now."
1887,"It is our mission to correct this twisted world, and I will show no mercy if you try to resist."
1888,"Face your judgment from us; it shall be your only salvation."
1889,"When all the wrongs have been corrected, the world will return to its rightful course. There is nothing to fear."
1890,"There is only one truth; and to get to it we simply have to eradicate all obstacles that stand in our way."
1891,"I am here to correct all the wrongs of this world."
1892,"Your very existence in this world is a mistake!"
1893,"Have the leaders of this world stooped so low in their games?"
1894,"Everything has descended into madness because of such existence like you!"
1895,"Bearing resemblance with that, I am going to destroy you as my sister has done!"
1896,"Come, Lord Noichrome, please fight me!"
1897,"Don't put on that ferocious look; we are only sparring."
1898,"I would love to have a cup of tea with you under different circumstances."
1899,"Know your place, you foolish imbecile who resort to emotions for judgment."
1900,"I am not going to go down without a fight; I shall be your opponent."
1901,"A tad feisty, aren't you?"
1902,"Be prepared; I am not going to pull any punches."
1903,"We do not have the time to spare; come, fight me."
1904,"Why must I be stuck with a mechanical puppet?"
1905,"What you are angry about?"
1906,"I hate machines, although I can't remember why."
1907,"In addition to babysitting a puppet, she also had to fight the monsters too."
1908,"Your master must be quite powerful."
1909,"It is for our sake that the Holy Lady had given us the trial."
1910,"Has it ever occurred to you that taking on a trial just because someone asked you to"
1911,"sounds incredibly fishy?"
1912,"These are the dead after all and they can't live on without their master."
1913,"Sigh, this is frustrating."
1914,"What is irking you?"
1915,"You need to let your habit of asking everything go."
1916,"If you irritate me more than you do now, I might destroy you on a whim."
1917,"What a greedy dragon; even in death it has not let go of its treasures."
1918,"Yeah, the dragon and the treasures have all been reduced to ash."
1919,"I could surely use some treasure if there's any of it left."
1920,"That's a pity."
1921,"That's the price the dragon had to pay for inducing so many people into insanity. Just let it vanish quietly."
1922,"Are you going to destroy me as well?"
1923,"...No, you are coming with me."
1924,"I want you to see with your own eyes what we are about to do in the world above."
1925," You will need this to recover the memories you have lost."
1926,"In order for you to regain all your memories, you will need to collect this."
1927,"There are different types of fragments: memory, life, death, time and soul."
1928,"I know the types you need."
1929,"Now that we have collected so much, we should be able to recover your memory."
1930,"If you wish to recover all your memories, collect those fragments."
1931,"What is this?"
1932,"I see, I guess that means I'd better follow your instructions."
1933,"I found a fragment of another color. Are there different types of fragments?"
1934,"Right, this means collecting just one type of fragment will not do."
1935,"Does this mean that by collecting these fragments, I will be able to know who I am?"
1936,"Not all; I only recovered a part of my memory."
1937,"So if we collect all the fragments, you will have all of your memories back? Not a problem."
1938,"What is this? It makes my head hurt just looking at it."
1939,"So that's what has been causing my headache?"
1940,"Although the color is different, the object is identical to what we found previously."
1941,"I see. Let's go collect them then."
1942,"That will help me regain my all memories?"
1943,"I guess this means things aren't that simple."
1944,"It looks like I will still be your companion for now."
1945,"I picked up something like a gem; do you know what this is?"
1946,"Is that so? All I need to do to recover my memory is to defeat monsters?"
1947,"Is this a fragment too?"
1948,"If it doesn't do anything by itself, let's just collect more."
1949,"I see; it would be great if I could remember everything."
1950,"Anyway, it would be fine as long as we keep fighting."
1951,"What's this? It looks different from gems."
1952,"Is that right? Well let's collect them."
1953,"It is frustrating not being able to remember anything."
1954,"Is this a fragment too? The color is a little different though."
1955,"Oh, is that right."
1956,"That's great; does that mean I will get to recover my memory?"
1957,"Is that so... I guess things won't go so easily."
1958,"So beautiful! What is this exactly?"
1959,"Wonderful! I will be able to regain my memory, right?"
1960,"This piece of fragment is a bit different in color. Could this be related to my memory?"
1961,"If so, let's collect them. I will need your help."
1962,"Finally, will I regain my memory of this place now?"
1963,"I see... But we can finally see a glimpse of hope at last."
1964,"I will be counting on you too from now on."
1965,"So he ran away. I seem to recall seeing that kind of movement somewhere before."
1966,"Who could that assailant be?"
1967,"It was hard to determine under those circumstances."
1968,"It also bothers me that we know nothing about his purpose."
1969,"We should probably return if it gets dangerous."
1970,"That cannot be the movement of a human or a monster; could it be..."
1971,"Do you know something?"
1972,"Could it be him? No, it is too risky to make such judgment based on memory alone."
1973,"Missy, be sure to stay close to me."
1974,"If memory serves, he is..."
1975,"He used to be a servant of Goddess, just like I was."
1976,"Although he seldom appeared before you."
1977,"So why would he do such a thing?"
1978,"I do not know."
1979,"But he would not have acted in such a way without a good reason."
1980,"Let's take him back and treat his wounds before we get to the bottom of this."
1981,"So he ran away. I seem to recall seeing that kind of movement somewhere before."
1982,"Do you know something?"
1983,"Well yes, though I can't recall his face,"
1984,"I seem to have fought with that shadow before."
1985,"If that's true, something big could happen if we don't go after him."
1986,"Tsk tsk."
1987,"How could I have forgotten such a strange fellow? Have I gotten old already?"
1988,"Do you know him?"
1989,"I really can't say I do...?"
1990,"It is a little more complicated than that."
1991,"Right, let's go. If we don't hurry and find out his reason for attacking us,"
1992,"He will surely strike again."
1993,"He is..."
1994,"What? You knew him too?"
1995,"Yes. He was one of the Goddess' servants."
1996,"I see. So he wasn't really targeting us."
1997,"It was more like he went out of control for a reason."
1998,"What does that mean?"
1999,"If he served the Goddess, there's no way he'd damage the Mansion."
2000,"Or attack you."
2001,"So, what might have caused him to go out of control?"
2002,"That I do not know yet."
2003,"It would be better if we take him back to the Mansion and have someone who could heal him take a look at him."
2004,"What a nimble fellow! He just got away like that..."
2005,"Who was that assailant?"
2006,"We only saw something like a shadow."
2007,"But I think I have seen that figure somewhere before."
2008,"At any rate, there's a chance that he will strike again."
2009,"Let's go after him."
2010,"Hmmm....that figure, I must have seen it somewhere."
2011,"Have you seen him before?"
2012,"The impression is anything but pleasant."
2013,"So it could be someone seeking to exact revenge on us."
2014,"It looks like we have to proceed with caution."
2015,"I have seen him at the Mansion."
2016,"Oh? You know who that is?"
2017,"I don't know; I have only seen him."
2018,"Those at the Mansion might know his identity."
2019,"That means we have to take him back."
2020,"But we have completely wrecked him."
2021,"I am not sure if we can return him to his original state."
2022,"He appears faster than he looks, that fellow."
2023,"What exactly is that?"
2024,"At any rate, it would be bad if he were to escape and cause any more damage to the Mansion."
2025,"We have to go after him."
2026,"That move...I knew I have seen him before."
2027,"Do you know him?"
2028,"...As much as I hate to doubt my own companion."
2029,"Regardless, he is too dangerous right now."
2030,"Missy, be sure to stay close to me."
2031,"He is..."
2032,"So you have seen him too, Missy?"
2033,"Yes, he was like us, a servant of the Goddess."
2034,"Is that so? But why would he do such a thing?"
2035,"I have no idea. He had always been one of the most enigmatic amongst us."
2036,"If we take him back and cure him, perhaps we can get some useful information from him."
2037,"What is that guy exactly?"
2038,"I don't know. Such things have never happened before..."
2039,"I am sorry; I didn't mean to blame you."
2040,"But we can't just let him off like that."
2041,"Let's go after him now!"
2042,"That fellow...so it was him...!!"
2043,"He doesn't look like the type that you would be acquainted with."
2044,"Not long after coming to this world, I saw him once on the news."
2045,"He was among one of the villains that caused quite a stir at the place I lived."
2046,"But....why here?"
2047,"I have seen him before at the Mansion."
2048,"Someone you knew?"
2049,"If that's the case, why would he attack you?"
2050,"I am sorry. I have no idea."
2051,"Is that so..."
2052,"Perhaps it has something to do with whatever nefarious acts he had done at the place I lived."
2053,"Those at the Mansion might know something."
2054,"Let's take him back first and see what happens."
2055,"Tsk, that was quick of him to run. Hey, what is up with that fellow?"
2056,"I am sorry. I have no idea."
2057,"Honestly? But then again, I think I have seen him before."
2058,"No matter what, it seems we need to go after him."
2059,"Now I remember...no wonder I thought I have seen him somewhere before."
2060,"What do you know about him?"
2061,"That was the jerk that came and sabotaged our place."
2062,"I lost a few of my men."
2063,"Now I am going to catch him, no matter what."
2064,"I think I have seen him at the Mansion."
2065,"This is really strange."
2066,"The fellow was coming after you."
2067,"If he were someone at the Mansion, why would he do something like that?"
2068,"Who knows? If it really bothers you..."
2069,"Just take him back and ask him."
2070,"I have my revenge...the rest is up to you."
2071,"What a quick guy. So what should we do, Missy?"
2072,"If he comes to attack the Mansion again, could we stop him?"
2073,"That's a good point."
2074,"If we let him escape now, the Mansion might be damaged again."
2075,"We have to stop him."
2076,"That is... So it really is him."
2077,"Someone you knew...?"
2078,"No, I still cannot be sure."
2079,"But if he were who I think he is, we have to stop him now."
2080,"Let's get moving."
2081,"Could he be?"
2082,"Yes, Missy."
2083,"He was just like us; a servant of the Goddess."
2084,"So why would he do such a thing?"
2085,"I don't know, but if we take him back and treat him"
2086,"We may soon find out why."
2087,"Hmm, so fast."
2088,"Would it be better if we just go back now?"
2089,"No, we can't just let him off."
2090,"It would be troublesome if he returns to attack the Mansion again."
2091,"So it was really him?"
2092,"Do you know who he is?"
2093,"Yes, we must go after him. That guy is just like us..."
2094,"Got it, let's get moving."
2095,"I remember...he is one of those at the Mansion right?"
2096,"That is right, but why would he do such a thing..."
2097,"I have no idea. We can only take him back and press him for the reason."
2098,"Good point. This fellow is more loyal to the Goddess than anybody else."
2099,"There must be a reason behind his action."
2100,"Tsk~ He got away. What's with that guy?"
2101,"Beats me."
2102,"So, I guess that means we got to catch him and ask him. Let's go!"
2103,"Ah, now I remember. He was the fellow from then..."
2104,"Do you know him?"
2105,"Are you kidding me? I wouldn't know anyone like that."
2106,"That's a freak murderer! No one knows his true identity."
2107,"And he just vanished without anyone noticing."
2108,"I saw him once at the Mansion."
2109,"Errm, he used to live with you?"
2110,"Give me a break."
2111,"But he has never tried to attack me, until now."
2112,"Now that's something strange. I guess we can get some information out from him if we fix him."
2113,"As much as I am against the idea of taking him back"
2114,"We can't just leave someone from the Mansion here like this."
2115,"What's the deal with that guy? He is gross."
2116,"What is up with that?"
2117,"How would I know?"
2118,"But we can't just leave him like that; too dangerous."
2119,"Let's go after him."
2120,"Still able to move with injuries like that? What kind of fellow is he?"
2121,"What should we do?"
2122,"Are you serious? We keep going after him of course."
2123,"If we just leave it like this, he might come back again once he's recovered from his injuries."
2124,"I have seen him before at the Mansion."
2125,"Oh? A companion of yours?"
2126,"Does this mean one of your companions has attacked you?"
2127,"Is that so? But I have no idea why he did so."
2128,"If you really want to find out, why don't we take him back and treat him?"
2129,"Although I don't believe that a lunatic like him"
2130,"have anything sane to say."
2131,"He got away."
2132,"If we let him off now"
2133,"He may return to attack the Mansion again."
2134,"Let's pursue him."
2135,"He is injured."
2136,"But we don't know what he is capable of."
2137,"Let's proceed with caution."
2138,"That clown should be someone from the Mansion."
2139,"Although I can't figure out why he would want to destroy the Mansion."
2140,"Let's bring him back; I want to ask him why he is doing this."
2141,"So it really is you..."
2142,"You are just the way you were...best at going out of control."
2143,"Who knew I would run into the freak murderer of the City of Damned."
2144,"Vihre, why would you..."
2145,"So this is the identity of the mysterious villain."
2146,"It's time to pay back for all the chaos and havoc you have caused!"
2147,"If you wish to continue with your destruction, I will be forced to stop you."
2148,"I am sorry, Vihre...but I can't allow you to go on like this."
2149,"So this is the freak murderer? What a strange looking fellow."
2150,"What a strange clown! Is he a machine too?"
2151,"For the Goddess! That is Vihre's..."
2152,"Can you show me the emotion that will trigger rage?"
2153,"I want to know what it feels like to enjoy battle. Come, fight me!"
2154,"Let me experience the joy of being the victor!"
2155,"Would I feel sad if my companion was hurt? I would like to find out."
2156,"What can I gain in this world?"
2157,"Master...where has the other master gone?"
2158,"Although you have forgotten me, I still remember you, my sister."
2159,"Oohuhuhu! My adorable adorable doll! Let's play."
2160,"This feels so familiar..."
2161,"So, which way should we go next?"
2162,"This way, follow me."
2163,"Got it. Since I can't remember a single thing, I will leave it to you."
2164,"We have finally won! This is the first time that I wasn't able to move my legs."
2165,"Are you scared?"
2166,"I did feel signals of danger from my brain."
2167,"If that is what [fear] is, then yes."
2168,"It has gotten quiet."
2169,"Are the dead controlled by the vampire finally able to rest in peace now?"
2170,"The sun has risen too."
2171,"There are so many things we don't know. But that is why there's so much to learn."
2172,"Come; let's head for the next destination."
2173,"Apparently, for the dragon, the treasure is so important that it is worth risking its own life."
2174,"Is that why it chose to burn to ashes along with the treasure?"
2175,"So that it could still be with the treasure even if it means its own demise."
2176,"That, perhaps, is what we call [being attached]."
2177,"Lady Mia, I am sorry."
2178,"But I wanted to stop you from committing worse crimes."
2179,"The heart of the Goddess has been purified and it is with me."
2180,"Please don't cry."
2181,"So this is [tenderness]? I finally understand it now..."
2182,"Thank you."
2183,"As long as I have Rob with me, I shall survive even in a world such as this."
2184,"As grateful as I am to you, I still find you an eyesore!"
2185,"Doctor, why haven't you given me knowledge?"
2186,"Has that empty brain of yours been filled with something?"
2187,"I am sorry Sheri, I don't have the time to answer you right now."
2188,"What is the world you see through your eyes?"
2189,"Can you spare me one of your spiders?"
2190,"I must respectfully refuse because I cannot increase their numbers in this world."
2191,"Does that freak belong to one of the worlds you have seen?"
2192,"That...does anyone know what this world is like?"
2193,"Although I have got to fight, I must say I am thrilled to meet a human!"
2194,"Do you know the way to return to your own world?"
2195,"What kind of world have you come from?"
2196,"This must be the strangest world, don't you think so?"
2197,"Father!? Is it really you?"
2198,"Or am I hallucinating?"
2199,"You were saying about going this way after leaving the forest?"
2200,"Yes."
2201,"It would be great if the next place were a bit brighter."
2202,"Not so tough after all. But then again, this world is surely full of these monsters."
2203,"Is it?"
2204,"Yes it is!"
2205,"Although I have been to many places, I have never been anywhere that has such an endless waves of monsters!"
2206,"It turned to the morning after the vampire has been defeated! That's neat!"
2207,"Apparently all the dead are gone."
2208,"Which means that they must have been the works of that vampire."
2209,"Does that mean we might have actually done a great thing?"
2210,"It is a major treasure after all that the dragon wanted"
2211,"These treasures must be worth a lot."
2212,"But it is all gone now."
2213,"So no one will ever fight for them again."
2214,"While it may be a pity, but I'd say that's a pretty good outcome."
2215,"So scary Goddess like this actually exists."
2216,"So what do we do next?"
2217,"I don't have a goal. How about you?"
2218,"The only thing I can do is to go to the next world."
2219,"If you don't have anywhere else to go, then come with me!"
2220,"It's time to let everything return to its primitive form."
2221,"Everything is born and then dies."
2222,"You are my light. Come, embrace all of it with me."
2223,"No one can escape the gaze of my «EYE»!"
2224,"I'll let you see the power of my world dominating «EYE»!"
2225,"Do you pity me? What a foolish thought."
2226,"Is this all you want?"
2227,"Do not give me that look that says you don't care where you are going to die!"
2228,"Mom, it's better if you didn't give birth to a child like me."
2229,"Only I can decide it all. I don't need your power."
2230,"Don't worry about me. I won't die yet."
2231,"Do you want to live if you turn into something like that?"
2232,"I won't just let you get destroyed. What I will do to you will be much more miserable."
2233,"We have to achieve higher level for this world."
2234,"To become stronger, I'm going to do this with everything I have!"
2235,"I'm going to beat you into pieces!"
2236,"Don't stand in the way, I have urgent affairs."
2237,"Is that the form of humans ? Then I..."
2238,"Fighting is my instinct. Anyway, I think there is something wrong."
2239,"I sensed a familiar aura. Where do you come from ?"
2240,"I come here to help."
2241,"What's that look ? A monster like me is not rare, is it ?"
2242,"Do you know what I used to look like ?"
2243,"Ah, I recall something about you."
2244,"That look...are you a warrior of the company ? Well, your look is..."
2245,"How could it be..."
2246,"So everything was taken away by the vortex ?"
2247,"What happened to you on the other side of the vortex ?"
2248,"That...is how a warrior becomes after being engulfed by the vortex ?"
2249,"Are you serious ?"
2250,"Anyone who fails to escape the vortex becomes like you ?"
2251,"You... how can it be...how is that..."
2252,"Where are you going ?"
2253,"To the side of the holy woman."
2254,"I'll listen to you and go if my memory can be restored."
2255,"It's funny to see a monster taking down another."
2256,"To me, you are a human."
2257,"Do you think I am ?"
2258,"So, it's even funnier."
2259,"The dawn has come. I haven't seen sunrise for a long time."
2260,"Sunrise is rare in this world."
2261,"Oh, is it ? Well, I've seen this scene before..."
2262,"Everything is lost when too much effort is given to something."
2263,"Is wealth so valuable to it ?"
2264,"Just like I put everything into my memory and physical body. Value varies with each individual."
2265,"How much wealth is valued by a dragon"
2266,"is only known by itself."
2267,"The holy woman fell"
2268,"but the memory I've been looking for is still missing."
2269,"I lost my motivation."
2270,"Well, why not travel with me ?"
2271,"I'll look for my memory, you'll find the meaning of your life."
2272,"I shall insist till the end, no matter who harbors hatred against me."
2273,"You have found the wrong person for your hatred!"
2274,"Show me your necromancy powers and we shall see how potent it is."
2275,"No matter how many times you return to life, you will always end up as the rusts of my sword."
2276,"The only rightful place for a specter is in its grave, and that is where you shall remain!"
2277,"There's nothing I can do for you, even if you choose me as a target for your hatred."
2278,"No matter how many times you fight me, the outcome will never change!"
2279,"I guess all that is left for me to do is to defeat this fellow, right?"
2280,"......!!"
2281,"I shall purify everything!"
2282,"When I am done with you, you'd never want to challenge me again."
2283,"I guess this is the outcome of our own deeds..."
2284,"Return to the darkness once more."
2285,"My attack will stay true, no matter how much hate you have for me."
2286,"That power of yours is truly intriguing... let me study it more closely."
2287,"I have no time for gloomy fellows like you!"
2288,"This is scary... but I can't lose this fight!"
2289,"I thought we'd become best of friends, what a shame."
2290,"Looks like a subject that is worth studying. Show me all of your powers."
2291,"What a powerful consciousness! But if there's a physical vessel, I will be able to destroy it!"
2292,"If you hinder my mission, I'll have no choice but to vanquish you."
2293,"I am weary of all the nonsense babbled by the weak, be gone!"
2294,"I don't care who you are; if you are trying to bring chaos to the world, I will show no mercy!"
2295,"You shall burn until no trace of your meaningless consciousness remains in this world."
2296,"And you are satisfied with this?"
2297,"Your thoughts are pure, I'll give you that. But..."
2298,"I will destroy you, along with the hatred that drives you!"
2299,"Things will definitely get worse if I don't defeat you now!"
2300,"The weak shall behave like the weak; prepare to meet your doom!"
2301,"A detective like me is not one to handle a creature like this!"
2302,"Entertain us with your powers!"
2303,"It looks like you are going to stand in our way, no matter what."
2304,"I shall split you into half along with your hatred."
2305,"Hahahahaha! That power of yours is truly marvelous!"
2306,"I guess I will do this to prove my justice!"
2307,"As much as I dislike the idea, I have got to take him out right?"
2308,"I shall return you to your grave once more."
2309,"Grudge...Hatred... How pathetic..."
2310,"I must defeat you before the Mansion gets involved in this."
2311,"My music shall erase everything, be it your grudge or hatred."
2312,"Can grudge or hatred be healed?"
2313,"You shall be undone, specter!"
2314,"Would you like to use that power of yours on something more interesting?"
2315,"Come, show me the beauty of your hatred!"
2316,"Grudge and hatred... has the time to liberate everything come?"
2317,"Looks like I won't be able to spare the energy for observation."
2318,"There's something I must do, no matter how much you hate me!"
2319,"Rest in peace once more!"
2320,"It's no good even if you keep going berserk like this."
2321,"So that's your hatred? That's it? You are not even worthy to be my foe."
2322,"And I shall smash you into bits as you have wished."
2323,"Would you learn to behave if I defeat you once more?"
2324,"Stop struggling! You've already died once, have you not?"
2325,"No..no..no..no matter which way you are going to come at me, bring it on!!"
2326,"Very well, come!"
2327,"So this is what happens when a spirit becomes twisted after death? I shall bring judgment upon you once more!"
2328,"What a terrible pumpkin... but I've got to take you out!"
2329,"When I am done with you, you won't be uttering another word."
2330,"Be a good specter and go to heaven or hell where you belong!"
2331,"I shall correct the fate that has been twisted by hatred."
2332,"I am perturbed by your hatred on me, please save it for someone else!"
2333,"Although I have empathy for you, that doesn't mean you should target your hatred on me."
2334,"So this is hatred? What a terrible emotion to have!"
2335,"This could be tricky, but I can't lose!"
2336,"Come, I shall endure all the hatred you have harbored."
2337,"Each and everyone of you shall taste the hatred of my kins you have defeated!"
2338,"The barrier has disappeared; we can move on now."
2339,"But... the number of specters have increased. Wouldn't that be a problem?"
2340,"We have no idea when the swede monsters would revive again."
2341,"Let's just watch our back and move on with caution."
2342,"Pumpking...? Where'd he get the power to command the specters?"
2343,"This had never happened before."
2344,"So where exactly had he obtained such power?"
2345,"It seems like Druid really hates us."
2346,"Perhaps it has something to do with him."
2347,"Could it be because we have defeated the Pumpking many times?"
2348,"That might be."
2349,"But... we can't let the number of specters grow any further."
2350,"Did his hate materialize into his physical vessel?"
2351,"Does this mean that if we keep defeating these monsters, he will eventually appear again?"
2352,"If this had been the result of his fury, then it could very well happen."
2353,""
2354,"...... If it is going to appear again,"
2355,"I really wish it wouldn't be the Pumpking."
2356,"What's the matter?"
2357,"No, it's nothing."
2358,"It looks like the barrier is gone."
2359,"And there is still a horde of specters lingering before us."
2360,"At any rate, even if we stay here, it looks like we will be surrounded eventually."
2361,"What should we do?"
2362,"We move on. Be sure to stay close."
2363,"I guess we are really hated."
2364,"We have taken out too many monsters after all."
2365,"Is that the reason that caused the specters to appear in such a great number?"
2366,"Might be."
2367,"But...how did the Pumpking obtain his power to command the specters?"
2368,""
2369,"Beats me."
2370,"It has never happened before."
2371,"It would be great if we could find out the cause of this when we get to the Pumpking..."
2372,"So this is what the Pumpking has turned into... hatred really is a terrible thing."
2373,""
2374,"And the specters have vanished."
2375,"So the Pumpking really was the culprit behind this?"
2376,"If we keep defeating more monsters, perhaps he would appear once more."
2377,"Even so, there are things we still must do."
2378,"If he were to get in our way, we'd have no choice but to defeat him."
2379,"Although the barrier is now gone, the presence of specter remains strong."
2380,"That seems to be the case. What should we do?"
2381,"Beings that have lost their soul are nothing to fear."
2382,"Let's move on."
2383,"The power to manipulate the specters..."
2384,"I didn't realize the Pumpking had such power."
2385,"It was the first time for me to witness that power as well."
2386,"That is the power of hatred...I am very familiar with that emotion."
2387,"I am beginning to look forward to meeting him."
2388,"Do you mean to say that this area has been created out of hatred?"
2389,"And if we were to keep defeating monsters, it would happen again?"
2390,""
2391,"It could happen again."
2392,"But hatred, fear, envy... I am very used to enemies driven by such emotions."
2393,"It's nothing more than a vegetable and no match for me."
2394,"The barrier is gone now, we can press on."
2395,"Good, let's find the cause as quickly as possible."
2396,"That's a despicable move from the Pumpking."
2397,""
2398,"So the Druid and Swede were both henchmen of the Pumpking."
2399,"I can't help but wonder how he obtained the power to control the specters and how he got his underlings."
2400,""
2401,"I get this feeling that it has to do with a very intense emotion."
2402,"We will find out once we get to the Pumpking."
2403,"It is a truly intense feeling of grudge."
2404,"But... as long as my weapon could hit it, it matters not."
2405,"But it is possible that some other existence that has obtained similar powers could be waiting to ambush us."
2406,""
2407,"Well as long as the enemy is at this level, we shouldn't have much problem."
2408,"It could awaken as a stronger congregation of malevolent forces, couldn't it?"
2409,"I am not so weak as to be bested by the likes of a specter or evil spirit."
2410,"No matter what evil awakes, I shall hack them all to pieces."
2411,"This guy wouldn't suddenly start moving again, would he?"
2412,"Probably not, I think."
2413,"Then let's get out of here ASAP."
2414,"I am not used to spooky places like this."
2415,"It looks like we are really hated..."
2416,"Why would the Pumpking hate us so much?"
2417,"Heh, just how many Pumpkings have we taken out so far?"
2418,"Isn't that a crystal clear reason as to why we are hated?"
2419,"So it is because of us then?"
2420,"What a powerful fluctuation of emotions."
2421,"If we keep defeating more monsters, something like this might happen again."
2422,""
2423,"It might."
2424,"But we have gotten him good this time and maybe he would be discouraged from trying to get his revenge?"
2425,"Is that so?"
2426,"No one knows what's going to happen."
2427,"There's no reason for us to be afraid of things that might not even show up."
2428,""
2429,"It is not moving... right?"
2430,"Well the barrier is gone now; I don't suppose he will come back to life."
2431,"That's wonderful...but we still have a horde of specters ahead of us..."
2432,"And they look full of hate for us..."
2433,"Just like how the Pumpking and Druid hate us?"
2434,""
2435,"It might have something to do with the Pumpking's ability to command the specters."
2436,""
2437,"So, before those specters attack the mansion, we've got to do something."
2438,""
2439,"Got it! Let's go and find the Pumpking."
2440,"Grudge...Hatred..."
2441,"The Pumpking's heart is filled with those emotions."
2442,"Isn't there a way to purge those emotions for him?"
2443,"Well, we were the ones who kept defeating his kins and other monsters and consequently leading to this."
2444,""
2445,"So there's nothing we can do for him."
2446,"Does this mean that he might appear again?"
2447,"As long as we keep defeating monsters, he should show up again."
2448,"It would be great if he tastes better than he appears."
2449,"I think it's dangerous to eat such things."
2450,"I didn't say I was really going to do it."
2451,"It was just a silly remark."
2452,"Has the Pumpking ever yielded the power to control the specters?"
2453,"This is the first I've heard of it."
2454,"The Pumpking might have gone through some mutation."
2455,"Hmmm."
2456,"I think it might be related to a powerful force that we do not yet know."
2457,"Only way to find out is to go to the Pumpking and see for ourselves."
2458,"So...the Pumpking has been driven with grudge and hatred all this time."
2459,"Does this mean that the dead monsters are helping him?"
2460,"Well because they are not like me; they don't get a second chance."
2461,"So the emotions he couldn't handle keep piling up and perhaps he is just overloaded with it."
2462,""
2463,"If we can unwind the hands of time, could things have turned out differently?"
2464,""
2465,"Well if they ever try to attack us, even if we could go back in time, the outcome would be the same."
2466,""
2467,"Well apparently he is responsible for this troublesome barrier."
2468,"Let's move on."
2469,"The specters in this area seem to have increased in number."
2470,"Is that so? Well it makes little difference to me if I have to face these specters."
2471,"So all those specters were under the Pumpking's control...?"
2472,"I never knew"
2473,"the Pumpking had that sort of power."
2474,"Is that so..."
2475,"The specters have nothing but feelings of hate."
2476,"I get this feeling that I just can't shake off."
2477,"We have defeated many of their kind."
2478,"It's only natural that we become targets of their hatred."
2479,"Well what if something has happened to change his power..."
2480,"Let's get going."
2481,"As expected, that hatred has been the cause of everything."
2482,"And the specters have vanished from the castle."
2483,"Does this mean the forest has also returned to normal and that this is the end of it...?"
2484,"Something still irks me."
2485,"It's nothing...there are plenty of opportunities for us to become target of someone else's hatred."
2486,"Does this mean what had happened will happen again?"
2487,""
2488,"Who knows?"
2489,"Let's worry about it when it has actually happened."
2490,"More importantly, I am tired and I need to take a rest."
2491,"The barrier has disappeared, but the specters have grown in number."
2492,"..............."
2493,"We go forward right? Let's go."
2494,"It looks like we are really hated..."
2495,"..............."
2496,"Let's take out the Pumpking."
2497,"It's the only thing for us to do at this point."
2498,"If we keep defeating monsters, the Pumpking will eventually show up once more."
2499,""
2500,"..............."
2501,"Are you sure you want to move on knowing what could happen?"
2502,"................"
2503,"I see. I will continue to be your guide."
2504,"That's an unnerving swede."
2505,"Has it been possessed by a specter too?"
2506,"That could very well be, considering the barrier is now gone."
2507,"There's no guarantee that he won't come back to life again."
2508,"Let's leave this place."
2509,"Just as I thought; someone is manipulating the specters."
2510,"Does the Pumpking have that sort of power?"
2511,"First time I've heard of it."
2512,"I also have no idea on what happened exactly there."
2513,"Regardless, I shall purge and purify everything that is evil."
2514,"The force of evil has been purified by the holy light."
2515,"The Pumpking shall no longer be able to interfere."
2516,"It will be great if that's the case..."
2517,"You seem to be concerned with something?"
2518,"It appears that the Pumpking has assimilated all the hatred from the monsters we have defeated unto himself."
2519,""
2520,"If we keep defeating monsters like this, could he appear eventually?"
2521,""
2522,"But... there are things we must do."
2523,"And if anyone stands in our way, we shall defeat them and move on."
2524,""
2525,"Alright the barrier is gone. Now we can move on."
2526,"But... I can still feel the presence of specters ahead of us."
2527,"Specters? I thought the fight is over when they are dead?"
2528,"That's troublesome."
2529,"Does this mean that pumpkin monster is controlling those specters?"
2530,"That seems to be the case."
2531,"So if we defeat that pumpkin, we can put an end to this?"
2532,"That's very likely."
2533,"But... those specters are driven by an intense grudge."
2534,"It could be very dangerous."
2535,"I don't recall having done anything that would make the dead hate me."
2536,"Not a problem for me I guess...unlike those guys, I won't die."
2537,"The specters in the castle have disappeared."
2538,"So that pumpkin fellow really has been the culprit behind all this."
2539,"It appears that the hatred and grudge of the dead have given the Pumpking that power."
2540,""
2541,"Hmm, whatever."
2542,"But... it is really foolish for one to be trapped by emotions like that even in death."
2543,""
2544,"As long as we keep defeating monsters,"
2545,"the same thing might occur again."
2546,"We won't be able to get anything done if we have to meddle in the affairs of the dead."
2547,"Come, let's go."
2548,"That's one disturbing swede..."
2549,"But it looks like it won't be moving anymore."
2550,"In that case let's get going; I don't feel comfortable here."
2551,"The Pumpking actually had the power to control the specters..."
2552,"I wasn't aware that the Pumpking had that sort of power."
2553,"It looks like the Druid hates us with a passion."
2554,"If the Pumpking shares the same sentiment as the Druid..."
2555,"So this is all because his hatred for us?"
2556,"I think it is highly possible."
2557,"The specters are growing in number. We have got to stop the Pumpking before the situation escalates further."
2558,""
2559,"This means the hatred and grudge of all the monsters we have defeated have been transferred to the Pumpking."
2560,""
2561,"Perhaps he himself had been bound by the thought of hatred."
2562,"The resonance of hatred has led to the creation of this gigantic castle that brought the specters to this world."
2563,""
2564,"How frightening."
2565,"But, if we keep defeating monsters, he might appear once more."
2566,""
2567,"But we have to press on nevertheless, right?"
2568,"Well, I guess we can feel good about having successfully stopped the Pumpking this time for now."
2569,""
2570,"The way to the castle has appeared."
2571,"It looks like the barrier has been created by the monsters."
2572,"I appreciate the simplicity of the matter. Let's go forth."
2573,"Pumpking with the power to manipulate the specters... where did he obtain such power?"
2574,""
2575,"Beats me."
2576,"It would be nice if we can solve the problem by defeating him..."
2577,"Don't you care about being hated?"
2578,"I have slayed no less than hundreds of monsters at this point; what good would care about such things do me now?"
2579,""
2580,"So the castle and specters have materialized due to the Pumpking's power of hatred."
2581,"This place is too quiet and it is freaking me out."
2582,"I don't know how we can prevent such things from happening again but it seems the affair is over for now."
2583,""
2584,"If we were to keep defeating monsters, something like this might happen again?"
2585,""
2586,"Hmm, well, if he stands in our way, I'll split him open, that's all."
2587,"Does that solve anything at all?"
2588,"That's the only option we have, so that's the only thing we will do."
2589,"That's all the monsters around here taken care of."
2590,"Now that the barrier is gone, we can move forward."
2591,"Excellent, let's go."
2592,"Seriously, where did that guy get this power to manipulate the specters?"
2593,"I don't know."
2594,"All I know was that he didn't show any sign of having such power before."
2595,"Well the Druid hated us very much too, so that might have something to do with it."
2596,""
2597,"So, the power of hatred could get stronger."
2598,"It looks like the earlier we defeat the Pumpking, the better."
2599,"Creating a castle and controlling the specters... the will of hatred is a terrible thing."
2600,""
2601,"Everything has disappeared except the forest."
2602,"Now we can have some peace for a while."
2603,"The Mansion is safe too... nothing to complain."
2604,"But if we keep defeating monsters, things like this could happen again."
2605,""
2606,"We don't have any means of stopping it from happening,"
2607,"so we will only worry about it when it happens."
2608,"I wonder what kind of mechanism allowed it to move..."
2609,"wouldn't it have been better if we'd just observe for a little longer?"
2610,"I think it is dangerous to be meddling with the specters."
2611,"How so? If we know the principle of their animation, we will be able to deal with them."
2612,"And when we do, the degree of danger would be much lower when handling them."
2613,"It seems the Pumpking has created both the castle and the specters."
2614,"I didn't know the Pumpking had such power."
2615,"The interesting thing about this world is the fact that you never could predict what is about to happen."
2616,"If such phenomenon had solely been the forces of hatred for us at work,"
2617,"that would be truly intriguing."
2618,"It is a shame though that I didn't get to measure just how much power the Pumpking has at his disposal."
2619,""
2620,"To me, it is a scary thought, nothing more."
2621,"And we can't let the specter grow further in number."
2622,"Hmm, I guess there are times when a burning fire has to be kept in check so that it does minimum damage..."
2623,""
2624,"The balance between research and safety shall be my focus from now on."
2625,"Is his appearance the only thing that is disturbing? I wasn't expecting that."
2626,"The barrier is gone; it looks like we can move forward now."
2627,"Let's get going then."
2628,"Let's leave this spooky place quickly."
2629,"It is really pesky despite being so weak."
2630,"But now we know who the culprit is."
2631,"It's the Pumpking, isn't it?"
2632,"Didn't we defeat a few of those big fellows?"
2633,"And the Pumpking...did he have the power to control the specters?"
2634,"I don't think he had that power before."
2635,"At any rate, it looks like we've got to find the Pumpking."
2636,"He surely took his defeat by us to mind,"
2637,"With henchmen so gloomy, he is just as gloomy himself. In fact, all the specters are gloomy."
2638,"Apparently even the monsters have feelings and opinions."
2639,"That, to me, is the whimper made by sore losers."
2640,"It looks like you have no intention of being bested by them."
2641,"Have you been paying any attention to me all this time?"
2642,"I am not one to lose to measly monsters."
2643,"Looks like we can press on!"
2644,"But the number of specters also seemed to have increased."
2645,"Compared to that, I am more concerned that the swede would start moving again."
2646,""
2647,"I think it would be a good idea if we leave this place as soon as possible."
2648,"Pumpking refers to the King of pumpkins, right?"
2649,"Yes."
2650,"But I wasn't aware that he had the power to subdue and command the specters."
2651,"Well the Druid hates us very much, that might have something to do with it."
2652,""
2653,"Let's go find the Pumpking."
2654,"Yes, and we'd better be quick!"
2655,"Oohh, this is so scary."
2656,"I have never been the subject of such hatred and fury from another."
2657,"Perhaps the Pumpking has been expressing the feelings on the behalf of those monsters?"
2658,""
2659,"I think he might also have been possessed by a specter, so what is it exactly?"
2660,""
2661,"I don't know."
2662,"But if he had been possessed, then the Pumpking would surely be able to rest in peace this time, right?"
2663,""
2664,""
2665,"What a cute swede."
2666,"I would love to make him my servant if he hadn't served someone else."
2667,"I think he is very scary, and it's definitely not something we can bring back to the Mansion."
2668,""
2669,"I see. That's a shame."
2670,"Alas, I love the feeling of this forest."
2671,"The deeper we go into the depths of the forest, the better I feel."
2672,"It looks like all these specters are the henchmen of the Pumpking."
2673,"Judging from what the Druid said, I suppose so."
2674,"So, if we defeat the Pumpking, I can do as I please with the specters?"
2675,""
2676,"That's hard to say."
2677,"Let's hurry to the Pumpking."
2678,"I look forward to it very much..."
2679,"It appears that the specters could not have lingered in the forest without the Pumpking's power."
2680,"It must be grudge and hatred that have summoned them."
2681,"If only we could keep them that way, I'd have been able to summon their physical bodies and make them my servants."
2682,"That's a terrible shame."
2683,"Well if we keep doing the same thing,"
2684,"it's very likely that another being like the Pumpking might appear."
2685,"It doesn't matter if we defeat them or not...one day everyone shall perish."
2686,"All I did was to deliver sweet death to them in advance."
2687,"So instead of hating me, they ought to thank me."
2688,"Just as I expected, the barrier has disappeared. Let's go."
2689,"But I could feel that the specters have increased in number."
2690,"I know that; you didn't have to tell me."
2691,"It's just a bunch of fellows that have died once, not a problem."
2692,"Is the Pumpking controlling these specters?"
2693,"Did he have such power before?"
2694,"No, it's the first time I've heard of it."
2695,"I see..."
2696,"The specters this time seem to be driven by an intense feeling of hatred."
2697,"But... that can't be it..."
2698,"What's the matter?"
2699,"No, it's nothing. But this is starting to intrigue me. Let's go."
2700,"Just as I thought."
2701,"This entire place has been materialized by the will of hatred."
2702,"If we keep defeating monsters, perhaps something like this might happen again."
2703,""
2704,"That means I will get more research materials, and that's great."
2705,"Intense emotion that results in the increase of entropy...what an interesting phenomenon."
2706,"This is rather rare."
2707,"So we keep moving forward, I suppose?"
2708,"Of course. I am also very interested in the stuff"
2709,"that the Goddess has in store for us."
2710,"That's a disturbing swede. I think we should burn it to ashes."
2711,""
2712,"That might be the safest thing to do."
2713,"With the number of specters increasing, we've got to ensure our safety."
2714,"I didn't expect to become the target of such intense hatred."
2715,"Perhaps the Pumpking hates as just as much."
2716,"This is very dangerous indeed."
2717,"It may also be related to the Pumpking's power to manipulate the specters."
2718,"We can't say for sure that the Pumpking is the culprit behind all this for now."
2719,"Before we can be sure of what will happen, let's move on with caution."
2720,"So both the castle and the specters came to existence because of hatred and grudge."
2721,"Did the Pumpking obtain power from those monsters and caused all these?"
2722,""
2723,"But...it looks like the Pumpking himself has been possessed by hatred and grudge."
2724,""
2725,"You mean these overwhelming emotions have driven the Pumpking to do all these?"
2726,"It's very likely. Hopefully when we defeat the Pumpking, we will be able to set him free..."
2727,""
2728,"The barrier that stood in our way has disappeared."
2729,"Now we can move on."
2730,"We must find the cause of this before the Mansion is involved."
2731,"It looks like both the swede and Druid are henchmen of the Pumpking."
2732,""
2733,"It was the first time for the Pumpking to lead his henchmen in battle."
2734,"Perhaps some powerful forces were driving them."
2735,"Would we be able to find the cause of this when we see the Pumpking?"
2736,"That should be the case. Let's get going now, my lady."
2737,"Apparently it has been hatred and grudge that has made the Pumpking so powerful."
2738,""
2739,"Is that the congregation of hatred and grudge from the monsters we've defeated?"
2740,"Perhaps there's something they have wanted to do as well."
2741,"But before they could accomplish their goal,"
2742,"they were defeated and their lingering hatred became the power that fueled the Pumpking."
2743,"Does this mean that the Pumpking is now the representative of those monsters?"
2744,"Regardless, anyone who intends to obstruct my lady's mission shall receive no mercy from me."
2745,""
2746,"The barrier that stood in our way has disappeared. We can now move on."
2747,"It seems there are still many specters waiting for us ahead."
2748,"While it is quite troublesome but I guess I have no choice but to kill them once again."
2749,"It would be much better if they'd just rest in peace, considering they are already dead."
2750,"I guess that's because we have defeated many of their companions."
2751,"Foolish creatures."
2752,"But that also revealed the fact that the Pumpking is in fact the culprit behind everything."
2753,"Once we take care of him, it would be the end of this meaningless farce."
2754,"That would certainly be nice if that's the case."
2755,"Well, if that doesn't wrap things up, we'll simply look for alternatives."
2756,"The specters and that ugly castle have both disappeared."
2757,"Apparently it was their intense hatred that has changed the appearance of the forest."
2758,"At any rate, it looks like this boring affair has finally come to its end."
2759,"Considering their intense hatred and grudge for us, something like this could happen again."
2760,""
2761,"Well if they wish to hate us, they can go right ahead."
2762,"To me it's just the lame excuses from the weak. Let's go."
2763,"To think that a mere swede monster actually tried to stop us with a barrier, how foolish."
2764,"The presence of the specters around us has grown stronger."
2765,"I know."
2766,"The specters will never be a match for me, regardless of their numbers."
2767,"Turning their hate on me is truly a foolish thing to do."
2768,"Well, that's because we've defeated their kins."
2769,"Hmph! And the Pumpking simply took advantage of their emotions. Pathetic."
2770,""
2771,"Does this mean the Pumpking is the culprit behind all this?"
2772,"Claiming to be a king with that insignificant power, the Pumpking is only trying to be clever."
2773,"I shall defeat him and have him kneel before me."
2774,"Is this the best he can do?"
2775,"And to think he actually created a castle from his hatred... it disgusts me."
2776,"Wasn't it because we defeated a lot of monsters that caused this to happen?"
2777,""
2778,"So what? I have no mercy for anyone who attempts to resist me."
2779,"Perhaps something like this might happen again."
2780,"And if it does, I will simply subdue them again with my power."
2781,"I will teach them once again how foolish it is to challenge me with that sort of emotion."
2782,""
2783,"It looks like now we can move on."
2784,"This swede monster... he wouldn't come back to life, would it?"
2785,"I have roasted him quite thoroughly and he will soon be the food for other animals."
2786,""
2787,"It looks like we are really hated. But we were only trying to protect ourselves."
2788,""
2789,"Even so, we did defeat a lot of monsters,"
2790,"which caused this to happen."
2791,"But if it is happening for a cause, we've got to deal with it."
2792,"Let's get to where the Pumpking is."
2793,"Just as I thought, everything disappeared after we defeated the Pumpking."
2794,"So we have destroyed all the specters at the same time, right?"
2795,"Who knows?"
2796,"We'll have to defeat hundreds of monsters before we can get to the Goddess, don't we?"
2797,""
2798,"In that case, we have to consider the possibility that this might happen again."
2799,""
2800,"Could the same thing happen again with another being other than the Pumpking?"
2801,""
2802,"Don't worry. Even if such a thing appears, I'll burn them till there's no trace of them left."
2803,""
2804,"What a disturbing swede...it looks like it can still move."
2805,"Well if you ask me, I don't think it will move again."
2806,"Regardless, we can't go wrong by being careful."
2807,"Just in case he suddenly moves again, let's press on while keeping an eye on our back."
2808,"It looks like the number of specters has increased."
2809,"Apparently this will not end until we defeat the Druid."
2810,"The Pumpking seems to be their master."
2811,"Are you suggesting that fellow has the power to manipulate the specters?"
2812,"Grudge...Hatred..."
2813,"Those might be the things that are driving the Pumpking."
2814,"What should we do?"
2815,"The only thing for us to do is to head to where the Pumpking is."
2816,"We have got to stop things from escalating."
2817,"All gone?"
2818,"Would that satiate the Pumpking?"
2819,"If he chose to gain satisfaction by assimilating the grudge and hatred of other monsters, that would be an option."
2820,""
2821,"And you are fine with that?"
2822,"There are many others who bear a grudge against me and it does me no good to concern myself with it."
2823,""
2824,"I heard that it is not a good thing to be hated..."
2825,""
2826,"Well I am prepared for whatever may come my way, even if it is something evil."
2827,"All I have to do is to add the monsters' share on top of it."
2828,"We can finally move on."
2829,"The swede looks like it won't be moving for good."
2830,"There might be other strong enemies ahead of us,"
2831,"let's not let our guard down."
2832,"So the Pumpking is the culprit behind all this?"
2833,"But... I didn't know that the Pumpking had the power to manipulate the specters."
2834,""
2835,"I wonder if the Pumpking had been withholding that power all this time"
2836,"or it had been a new power that he gained through some mutation..."
2837,"He is dangerous no matter what. Looks like we've got to take out the culprit as soon as possible."
2838,""
2839,"The purer an idea, the more it is susceptible to manipulation by others."
2840,"The same goes for the Pumpking."
2841,"It's possible that he wasn't able to withstand the collective will of the monsters and was himself consumed by the hatred."
2842,"It is also possible that he had nearly gone berserk, right?"
2843,"It's a good thing that we were able to take him out before things get worse."
2844,"What would have happened if we paid no attention to the matter and let him had his way?"
2845,"Being driven by an unquenchable grudge and hatred, the Pumpking might have extended his evil reach to the world."
2846,""
2847,"The barrier is gone."
2848,"The way to the castle has appeared."
2849,"So this disturbing swede was the one who created the barrier."
2850,"But at last, we are now able to move forward, this is great."
2851,"The situation seems to be worsening..."
2852,"Did the Pumpking have this power originally?"
2853,""
2854,"I don't think he was holding back that power deliberately... "
2855,"something might have happened to the Pumpking that caused him to mutate."
2856,"At any rate, it looks like we'd better hurry to the Pumpking."
2857,"Yes, let's get going."
2858,"So this is caused by the monsters that we have defeated..."
2859,"For our mission, we did defeat many monsters."
2860,"But we didn't expect things to turn out this way."
2861,""
2862,"No one could have predicted events that violate the providence."
2863,""
2864,"For now, let's celebrate for defeating the Pumpking."
2865,""
2866,"At last we can press on again."
2867,"Is it alright to leave the swede like this?"
2868,"Well if Sylph said it is alright, then it will probably stay that way."
2869,""
2870,"This is scary... Why would he hate us that much?"
2871,"It looks like the Pumpking is the master of Druid."
2872,"Is the Pumpking responsible for this malevolent force too?"
2873,"But the Pumpking has never manipulated the specters before this, right?"
2874,""
2875,"Yes."
2876,"Perhaps something had happened and gave him that power."
2877,"It would be great if defeating the Pumpking could solve the problem."
2878,"I guess we better buck up and do this..."
2879,"The castle and the specters have all disappeared."
2880,"So the Pumpking is behind all of this?"
2881,"According to Sylph, it was intense hatred and grudge that had turned the Pumpking into what he is now."
2882,""
2883,"So when a will turns into an obsession, something that violates the laws of nature and providence like this would happen?"
2884,""
2885,"It's the first time I have encountered something like this; I am not certain myself."
2886,"I hope something as terrible as this will not happen again."
2887,"But perhaps it may..."
2888,"That, I am not sure."
2889,"Is that so... I guess we've better be prepared then."
2890,"If we just leave the barrier as it is, wouldn't it keep the specter away from the Mansion?"
2891,""
2892,"No; specters have already been spotted near the Mansion and we can't just leave them to roam free."
2893,""
2894,"Whatever. I don't get many opportunities to slash specters."
2895,"I didn't know that the Pumpking had the mysterious to control the specters."
2896,""
2897,"He hadn't used that power until now... that's incredible."
2898,""
2899,"It matters not to me regardless of the power he has. The stronger my opponent is, the better I could hone my skills."
2900,""
2901,"Not admitting defeat, but relying on a greater power."
2902,"Too naïve."
2903,"But I think it is that resolve that has caused this phenomenon."
2904,""
2905,"So... a horde of weaklings would grow stronger when they congregate?"
2906,"Alas, that's nothing more than a collection of weaklings."
2907,"They would have been spared from the pain only if they adhered to the laws of providence."
2908,""
2909,"It doesn't matter if that's a barrier or not; looks like we can now move forward."
2910,""
2911,"We have got numerous specters waiting for us ahead."
2912,"In other words, defeating this guy isn't the end of this."
2913,"Come on, give me a break."
2914,"Is that pumpkin monster controlling those fellows?"
2915,"I have never heard the Pumpking wielded such power."
2916,""
2917,"Is that right? Never mind, we will just find out by asking the Pumpking himself."
2918,""
2919,"The real trouble lies in the emotions of those specters."
2920,"Emotion...?"
2921,"That will be hatred. Hatred leads to many things."
2922,"Oh my! It looks like this will be more troublesome than I thought."
2923,"Oh my! The power of hatred is so strong that it could create a castle?"
2924,"Even the campiest horror novel wouldn't have plots like this."
2925,"The presence of the monsters has disappeared."
2926,"That ought to do the trick?"
2927,"... It's hard to say,"
2928,"Intense emotions like hatred do not dissipate so easily."
2929,"Once you become the target of someone's hate, that hatred will spread."
2930,""
2931,"Do you mean to say that this could happen again in the future?"
2932,""
2933,"Possibly... but we have peace for now."
2934,"I think we can take a short rest."
2935,"Upon closer look, he does have an interesting appearance."
2936,"There's no guarantee that he won't come back to life again. This is dangerous."
2937,"Hmm, if he creates that barrier again it would be trouble. Let's go before he revives again."
2938,""
2939,"It looks like things will be more interesting than I thought."
2940,"I never knew that the Pumpking had the power to manipulate the specters."
2941,""
2942,"He might have gotten that power through mutation."
2943,"I would love to be able to observe the new power that the Pumpking has obtained in a close distance."
2944,"It would be good if we could stop the specters from growing in number..."
2945,"That we will figure out after we defeat the Pumpking."
2946,"Let's get going."
2947,"Insisting on hating us even in death...he is a tough one indeed."
2948,""
2949,"So where will the specters go from now?"
2950,"Who knows? If they had been attracted by the Pumpking's intense hatred,"
2951,"now they should return to their normal state."
2952,"If someone else wielding similar powers like the Pumpking, they might reappear once more."
2953,""
2954,"As long as we keep defeating monsters, this will not end."
2955,"But I see it as a form of entertainment for us; I have never experienced something like this."
2956,""
2957,"This swede monster seems to be the one who created that barrier."
2958,"Yes... but with the barrier gone, the specters ahead of us will now be able to get to the Mansion."
2959,""
2960,"I guess we'd better do something before the Mansion comes under attack."
2961,"The Pumpking with the ability to control the specters...I am truly surprised by such power."
2962,""
2963,"What happened to the Pumpking?"
2964,"Well that is something that only the Pumpking himself would know."
2965,"But one thing that's for sure: he hates us with a passion."
2966,""
2967,"Listen, my lady; if you ever think you are in danger, don't hesitate to retreat."
2968,""
2969,"It looks like the Pumpking is channeling the hatred of all the dead monsters unto him."
2970,""
2971,"If we keep defeating monsters, this would happen again repeatedly..."
2972,""
2973,"What is your mission, my lady?"
2974,"I must guide the warriors to the Goddess."
2975,"Well then, we will take this whole affair as a trial for ourselves."
2976,""
2977,"That is right; we are bound by a mission that we must complete."
2978,"And we can't stop here."
2979,"The barrier seems to be gone, let's go."
2980,"But...there seem to be a horde of specters waiting to ambush us."
2981,"I know, I can feel the presence of numerous specters ahead of us."
2982,"But, we have no choice but to press on, don't we?"
2983,"The power of that specter... it is an intense feeling of hatred."
2984,"That's because we have defeated many of their kind."
2985,"Nevertheless, I could feel a void in that hatred."
2986,"Perhaps that swede monster has been pulling the strings and controlling them."
2987,"I've never heard that the Pumpking had the power to control the specters."
2988,""
2989,"After fighting them, I am pretty sure he is behind this."
2990,"What incredible force of hatred! Thankfully he can still be defeated with our powers."
2991,""
2992,"The castle has disappeared."
2993,"Could it be because the will of the Pumpking has dissipated?"
2994,"Hmm, that's hard to say."
2995,"When my attack landed on him, it felt as if he was saying, [this isn't the end]."
2996,""
2997,""
2998,"So...it is possible that something like this could happen again in the future?"
2999,""
3000,"If we keep on killing monsters, perhaps."
3001,"It is hard to eradicate hatred..."
3002,"But, we have got to move on nonetheless."
3003,"Looking at this fellow's face makes me more intrigued than ever."
3004,"It does nothing but makes me feel uncomfortable."
3005,"You are just looking at it in the wrong way; from the way I see it, this fellow has got a really interesting face."
3006,"Hohoho, I think I see something interesting ahead."
3007,"Oh? I didn't know monsters would say such things,"
3008,"hahahah, that's weird."
3009,"Indeed...we have never seen monsters that have awareness for themselves."
3010,""
3011,"But now we know the Pumpking is behind this."
3012,"What should we do?"
3013,"Let's go find the Pumpking. I want to see his power of specter manipulation up close, hohohoho."
3014,""
3015,"The incredible power to command the specters..."
3016,"Perhaps it might be better off if we leave the Pumpking alone."
3017,""
3018,"That would expose the Mansion to danger."
3019,"Nothing is more pleasant than the unpredictable; I'd love to see something that exceeds my imagination."
3020,""
3021,"Our mission is to go to the Goddess."
3022,"Oh you are taking things too seriously."
3023,"Then again, going to the Goddess may offer another opportunity for me to see something interesting too."
3024,""
3025,"I can't guarantee anything, but something may change."
3026,"I am looking forward to it, hahahahahaha."
3027,"The barrier is gone, and the pave has appeared."
3028,"But it seems that we have nothing but specters waiting for us ahead..."
3029,"It would be bad if all of them get to the Mansion,"
3030,"we have got to find the cause soon!"
3031,"Did the Pumpking have this power originally?"
3032,"Not that I recall."
3033,"That's what I thought. So what exactly happened to the Pumpking?"
3034,"I guess the only way to find out is to get to him."
3035,"If we just leave him be, things will escalate very soon. Let's hurry."
3036,"We should be doing the right thing."
3037,"But now the monsters hate us."
3038,"Although I can't say for certain if those monsters were trying to uphold some sort of justice,"
3039,"it's a fact that we can't ignore."
3040,"It would be worthwhile even if this is the only thing we learn."
3041,"Yes, and I must also live with the fact."
3042,"And you will help me uphold justice! Let's do this!"
3043,"That swede...he won't be moving again will he?"
3044,"It would be bad if we were ambushed again."
3045,"Right?"
3046,"The number of specters has also increased... we must find the cause soon and do something about it."
3047,"What did we do that deserve such hatred?"
3048,"I don't know...but we may find out why when we find the Pumpking."
3049,""
3050,"Would the monsters actually tell us their reasons?"
3051,"I guess we don't really have any choice but to... let's do our best..."
3052,"So it is actually possible to create a castle out of grudge and hatred? This world is strange indeed."
3053,""
3054,"That's because we have defeated so many monsters..."
3055,"They were the ones to attack first!"
3056,"And then we defeated them. It isn't really fair that the aggressors get to attack and bear grudge against us!"
3057,"All we wanted to do is to get to the Goddess."
3058,"Yes, we have to press on, even if that means we have to defeat anyone that stands in our way."
3059,""
3060,"Well, this means we have got to accept it."
3061,"Although it's a bit hard to acknowledge it immediately..."
3062,"The barrier that stood in our way has disappeared, let's get going."
3063,"It seems that there are many specters waiting for us ahead."
3064,"Tsk, this is really troublesome. Why wouldn't the dead just rest in peace in their graves?"
3065,""
3066,"Is the Pumpking controlling those specters?"
3067,"Based on the information we have gathered so far, that seems to be the case."
3068,"Never mind, we will find out by asking him directly."
3069,"Speaking of which, the power of the grudge of that specter..."
3070,"We have defeated many of their kind so far and it is not a surprise for them to have such resentment for us."
3071,""
3072,"So a debt of blood must be paid in blood...is this what it is?"
3073,"To think that he even created a castle out of his grudge... how boring."
3074,""
3075,"As long as we keep defeating monsters, the same thing might happen in the future."
3076,""
3077,"So what? If we were to avoid being hated, we'd have to stop here."
3078,"We don't live in a naïve world like that."
3079,""
3080,"Well, you've got a point."
3081,"Anyone who attacks us, I shall kill. And if he comes back to life after death, I will just kill him again."
3082,"That's all there is to it."
3083,""
3084,"The path has appeared, does this mean we can continue forth?"
3085,"We should be able to, though the number of specters has also increased."
3086,"Let's hurry; I don't want anything to do with those specters."
3087,"My head hurts..."
3088,"I didn't realize the power of grudge and hatred could be so intense..."
3089,"Does this mean the Pumpking really hates us with a passion?"
3090,""
3091,"I don't know..."
3092,"But it is truly frightening if hatred could materialize into something physical and try to harm us..."
3093,""
3094,"So we have got no choice but to find the Pumpking then?"
3095,"Well, that seems to be the only choice..."
3096,"So the Pumpking was merely acting as a representative of those monsters who no longer could speak."
3097,""
3098,"The castle and specters have all vanished along with the Pumpking."
3099,"It would be wonderful if their negative emotions could disappear along with them."
3100,"If we keep killing monsters, that's not very likely."
3101,""
3102,"Even so, if those monsters stand in our way, we've got to take them out."
3103,"How sad..."
3104,""
3105,"Looks like we can continue on."
3106,"My lady, what should we do?"
3107,"Let's go."
3108,"It would be bad if we just leave those specters to attack the Mansion."
3109,"Good point; let's get going then."
3110,"My my...looks like we are truly hated."
3111,"Is the Pumpking controlling these specters?"
3112,""
3113,"If what the Druid said was true, then I am afraid it is."
3114,"Regardless, it looks like we've got to head for the Pumpking's castle."
3115,""
3116,"The castle and the specters have vanished."
3117,"So everything had been caused by the Pumpking's power."
3118,"I didn't know the Pumpking could turn into something like that..."
3119,"Grudge really is a terrible thing."
3120,"So if we keep traveling and defeating monsters, this would happen again?"
3121,""
3122,"That I don't know."
3123,"All I know is that we can't stop here, and you should know that better than anyone else."
3124,""
3125,"Yes,"
3126,"we must get to the Goddess."
3127,"So let's go. No matter where we go, I'll stay by your side and serve you."
3128,""
3129,"Is the barrier gone? That's one disturbing swede."
3130,"It won't be moving again, will it?"
3131,"Probably not, but it's hard to say if the body becomes possessed by a specter."
3132,"Then it would be better for us to leave it here and move on."
3133,"Strange... the Pumpking should not have the power to manipulate the specters..."
3134,"At least, nothing like that had happened until now."
3135,"What the Druid said is quite unnerving."
3136,"Grudge and hatred might have become the sources of the Pumpking's power."
3137,""
3138,"What should we do then?"
3139,"To solve all these problems, we might have to find the Pumpking."
3140,""
3141,"Just as I have guessed, the specters and the castle have all been the works of the Pumpking..."
3142,"Would this enable the monsters to rest in peace?"
3143,"Until they feel truly content, their grudge and hatred would never disappear."
3144,""
3145,"Even if their bodies have been buried, their souls would still cling on to their hatred."
3146,"In other words, the more monsters we defeat, the more specters there will be?"
3147,""
3148,"Possibly."
3149,"But we have no choice and we have got to accomplish our objective."
3150,"Yes, we don't have the time to spare for interruptions."
3151,"Yes, because both you and I have our own purpose."
3152,"Looks like we can finally move on."
3153,"And the path to the castle has also appeared."
3154,"Did the swede conceal even the road now? Looks like he really hated us."
3155,""
3156,"Did we do anything that deserves such hate from them?"
3157,"I guess we will find out when we get to the Pumpking."
3158,""
3159,"That's true..."
3160,"If you are going to get sad, you can do it later."
3161,"Grudge is truly a terrible thing."
3162,"So there's no end to this as long as we keep defeating monsters?"
3163,"To create the castle and manipulate the specters would require tremendous amount of power,"
3164,"so they won't appear again for now."
3165,""
3166,"That would be great if it's true."
3167,"We can only pray that it wouldn't appear again."
3168,"We can't get anything done if we keep worrying about it."
3169,"Is the barrier gone now? Let's continue on."
3170,"But there are more specters now."
3171,"Not a problem."
3172,"Mere specters and evil spirits are no match for the divine will."
3173,""
3174,"How foolish it is to summon the slumbering spirits before God."
3175,"It looks like both the Pumpking and Druid hate us very much."
3176,"Attempting to defy the fate that God has ordained is futile and foolish."
3177,"In God's name, they shall receive their judgment from me."
3178,"The blasphemous beings that dared defy God have been destroyed."
3179,"The specters and castle have disappeared."
3180,"I guess the forest has now finally been restored to its original state."
3181,"But I get this feeling that the hatred of monsters has not dissipated."
3182,"We have followed God's will to restore peace to the forest and the evil spirits have been purified and sent to God."
3183,"That ought to be sufficient."
3184,""
3185,"Now we can move on, although the number of specters seems to be growing."
3186,"Is it alright if we move forward like this?"
3187,"We can't guarantee that swede monster is dead for good; let's get going before the barrier reappears."
3188,""
3189,"Manipulating the specters? Did the Pumpking have such power before?"
3190,""
3191,"I never heard he had powers of that sort."
3192,""
3193,"Since we can't be sure of the cause, we have no choice but head for where the Pumpking is."
3194,""
3195,"Somehow I get this feeling that the Pumpking won't tell us anything."
3196,"If he is not in the mood to talk, we'll just make him. Simple."
3197,""
3198,"Being imprisoned by revenge or something like that... is the Pumpking really content with that?"
3199,""
3200,"Perhaps that's the only thing that is occupying his mind."
3201,"Does this mean if one turns into a specter, he would be bound to a specific emotion?"
3202,""
3203,"I don't know, but he did create a castle out of his hatred and even obtained the power to command the specters."
3204,""
3205,"Isn't there a better alternative that will make him happy other than using his powers on this?"
3206,""
3207,"What an ugly swede! I am going to make sure he never wakes up again."
3208,"The barrier has disappeared. Let's go."
3209,"It would be nice if we don't run into any uglier beings along the way."
3210,"Looks like things just got a bit more interesting."
3211,"Apparently the Pumpking has obtained the power to command the specters."
3212,"Although I don't know the cause of it, but I surely am interested now."
3213,"But they seem to hate us with a passion...this would be dangerous..."
3214,""
3215,"We have been in this dangerous world for so long now and now is not the time for fear."
3216,"Let's go, puppet."
3217,"I have witnessed the beauty of the Pumpking."
3218,"Is hatred a beautiful thing?"
3219,"Pure, unadulterated desire to kill and grudge will become beautiful and sharp fangs"
3220,"The Pumpking has proven that."
3221,"But you've defeated him."
3222,"That only means he is not beautiful enough to defeat me"
3223,"But it was quite a pity, really."
3224,"Alas we can move on now."
3225,"I see the way to the castle."
3226,"And there are numerous specters ahead of us..."
3227,"I guess we have got to move on with caution."
3228,"Is the Pumpking controlling these specters?"
3229,"I had no idea that the Pumpking had that sort of power."
3230,"Well, we will find out what made the Pumpking stronger when we meet him, won't we?"
3231,""
3232,"It would be good if that's the case..."
3233,"At any rate, we have got to go to the castle."
3234,"The power of hatred has dissipated."
3235,"Has the Pumpking been freed from hatred?"
3236,"I don't know, but as long as we keep defeating monsters,"
3237,"it is possible that there will be no ending to this."
3238,"But we must still press on."
3239,"That is right. We must get to the Goddess."
3240,"We can only pray that something like this doesn't happen again."
3241,"So it was this disturbing swede that set up the barrier."
3242,"Although we can continue forth now, the number of specters has also increased."
3243,"The specters here won't revive once they are defeated."
3244,"So no matter how many specters attack us, we just need to defeat them all."
3245,"It really surprised me that the Pumpking has the power to control the specters."
3246,"And so far, all he has done was to attack us. What on earth is going on?"
3247,""
3248,"I am taking a wild guess here, but the Druid seems to really hate us, maybe that has something to do with it."
3249,""
3250,"Is it because we have defeated many of the Pumpking's kins that amplified his hate so much that he has gotten such power?"
3251,""
3252,"If this is something that can be done through will alone, I'd love to observe it closely."
3253,""
3254,"Intense emotions that summoned powers that cannot be analyzed? What a fascinating case study!"
3255,""
3256,"It also shows how much the Pumpking hates us..."
3257,"Because we have defeated numerous monsters along the way for our own goals."
3258,"In other words, something like this could happen again?"
3259,"It's quite likely."
3260,"But if it happens again, I will be sure to study my subject closely before defeating him."
3261,"Not a problem."
3262,""
3263,"Looks like we can finally continue."
3264,"Apparently the swede monster was the one to set up the barrier."
3265,"But there are more specters now."
3266,"It would be good if we can determine the cause quickly..."
3267,"We are really hated, aren't we? Is this somehow related to that power to command the specters?"
3268,""
3269,"Is it because we have defeated many of the Pumpking's kins?"
3270,"That should be one of the reasons."
3271,"At any rate, we won't know for sure unless we go to the Pumpking."
3272,""
3273,"Let's go."
3274,"What intense hatred! I feel tingly all over!"
3275,""
3276,"That goes to show how much the Pumpking hates us, right?"
3277,"This means that camaraderie actually exists amongst monsters."
3278,"So as long as we keep defeating monsters, something like this would happen?"
3279,""
3280,"Personally, I don't want it to happen again. Not knowing what will happen"
3281,"is the scariest thing."
3282,""
3283,"Seems like we can move on now."
3284,"Hmm, but the number of specters seems to have increased."
3285,"We don't know when the swede monster would start moving again; it would be a good idea if we get going quickly."
3286,""
3287,"The Pumpking with the power to command the specter? Where exactly did he obtain that power?"
3288,""
3289,"I don't know."
3290,"But it looks like the Druid really hates us."
3291,"Grudge..."
3292,"That makes me feel uncomfortable, but it could be the reason."
3293,""
3294,"What's wrong?"
3295,"Looks like we have got to pay the Pumpking a visit."
3296,"Did hate and wrath turn the Pumpking into what he is now?"
3297,"The specters have relied on the Pumpking's power in order to linger in the forest."
3298,""
3299,"I wish they could just rest in peace like this."
3300,"As long as we keep defeating monsters, something like this would go on?"
3301,""
3302,"I guess we need a change a mood. But something like this happened unexpectedly must have affected your mood?"
3303,""
3304,"Let's take a short rest before deliberating over the matter."
3305,"It looks like this is the monster that set up the barrier."
3306,"The way to the castle has also appeared."
3307,"What a coincidence! It's almost like they are baiting us."
3308,""
3309,"But on the other hand, we can't afford to stay here either."
3310,"I guess we have to move on with caution."
3311,"Boy we are really hated."
3312,"Although we have defeated many of the Pumpking's kind..."
3313,"After assimilating their grudge and hatred, the Pumpking obtained the power to command the specters? That sounds likely."
3314,""
3315,"This won't end if we don't defeat the Pumpking, right?"
3316,""
3317,"Yes, let's go."
3318,"Just as we expected"
3319,"He had gone berserk due to his excessive rage."
3320,"The castle and the specters have disappeared."
3321,"So the Pumpking was controlling everything all along."
3322,"Being able to create a castle and command the specters just with hatred and rage alone is a scary thought."
3323,""
3324,"If we keep defeating monsters, he would appear again?"
3325,"As long as our goal remains, we must summon our courage to fight back and continue to defeat the monsters."
3326,""
3327,"We can only pray for our own safety when it happens again."
3328,"What a fragile barrier."
3329,"And it is gone like that, how boring."
3330,"Looks like the barrier was made by this swede monster."
3331,"The best that the monster could have done with its limited intelligence."
3332,"If they really wanted to stop us in our tracks, the monster should have separated himself from the barrier."
3333,""
3334,"The Pumpking? Looks like he really hates us."
3335,"Because we have defeated his kins?"
3336,"I am indifferent towards being hated by insignificant monsters."
3337,"Then again, if we just leave him like this, the thought would make me uncomfortable too."
3338,"Let's hurry to the Pumpking's place and get this taken care of."
3339,"I didn't know the monsters had a sense of camaraderie."
3340,"It was that will that not only created the castle but also command the specters..."
3341,"Relying purely on wrath could achieve so much...not even I could have imagined it."
3342,""
3343,"But as long as we keep defeating the monsters, something like the Pumpking could happen again?"
3344,""
3345,"Something like this could not stop us."
3346,"Even if he could come back to life again, he would only be defeated once again."
3347,"And now we can move on."
3348,"What do we do next?"
3349,"Let's head for that castle; we have got to find out what is causing the sudden surge of specters."
3350,""
3351,"I see. Alright, let's go forth."
3352,"Being hated like this isn't actually all that bad."
3353,"Isn't hate an emotion that people tend to avoid being targeted with?"
3354,"Anyone who attacks us with negative emotions will be our enemy."
3355,"And if they are our enemies, we can do everything in our power to defeat them."
3356,"Is that right..."
3357,"You are probably not ready for emotions like that."
3358,"Then let's hurry to the Pumpking; if we defeat the culprit, we should be able to solve this."
3359,""
3360,"If that would prevent the Pumpking from reappearing, that would be great."
3361,"As long as we keep defeating monsters, it's always possible that he would come back to life driven by rage."
3362,""
3363,"What should we do if the Pumpking appears again?"
3364,""
3365,"We give him what he justly deserves."
3366,"No matter what sort of enemy comes before us, all we have to do is to defeat them."
3367,""
3368,"The barrier is gone. Let's head forth."
3369,"But the specters seem to be increasing in number. Wouldn't that be a problem?"
3370,"We already know that the specters won't attack us, so I think that should be fine."
3371,""
3372,"Since there are so many of them, I should be able to capture a few of them as specimens, right?"
3373,"This is truly vexing."
3374,"Didn't expect to be hated by monsters."
3375,"Which means these monsters actually have a sense of camaraderie."
3376,"Regardless, we can't just leave those specters like that."
3377,"Yes, we must not."
3378,"So let's go find the Pumpking."
3379,"It would be nice if he could learn a lesson."
3380,"Considering the sort of emotions that are driving him, that's not very likely."
3381,"As long as we are still defeating monsters, it's basically impossible."
3382,"But we shall not go down without a fight."
3383,"Is that because our existence is not one that is compatible with the monsters?"
3384,"It is because we have our own goals to accomplish too."
3385,"As long as they still try to hinder us, they will be incompatible with us."
3386,""
3387,"Looks like we can move forward again, despite the increasing number of specters."
3388,"My lady, shall we continue like this?"
3389,"Yes; it would be bad if something were to happen to the Mansion."
3390,"Well, then let's continue on."
3391,"I don't recall having done anything that would make them hate me so much."
3392,"What exactly have we done?"
3393,"Who knows."
3394,"Perhaps only the Druid and Pumpking would know."
3395,"We should be able to find out once we get to the castle."
3396,"So it was the hatred of the monsters that has given power to the Pumpking."
3397,"So the monsters we have defeated...their hatred never did go away despite their death..."
3398,"They couldn't accept their own defeat."
3399,"So they built the castle and manipulated the specters in order to defeat us."
3400,"But they have failed."
3401,"That is right, because the stronger will has prevailed, that's all."
3402,"Let's get going; we can't afford to stay here!"
3403,""
3404,"Are you afraid of the specters?"
3405,"I don't handle anything that I can't physically beat up very well."
3406,"These fellows here, except for the monsters that have attacked us, seem to be harmless."
3407,""
3408,"Oh, that's the cry of specters..."
3409,"La la la ~ I am not hearing anything!"
3410,"Great, let's hurry and defeat the Pumpking!"
3411,"The Pumpking seems to have a new found power; wouldn't it be reckless if we were to just rush in without a plan?"
3412,""
3413,"Well we now know the reason why those specters have appeared and they REALLY hate us! We must hurry!"
3414,""
3415,""
3416,"That's true..."
3417,"Just you wait, Pumpking!"
3418,"So monsters actually get enraged like that huh."
3419,"It's good that we managed to defeat him before he went berserk beyond control."
3420,""
3421,"The castle and the specters have all disappeared."
3422,"Which means the Pumpking had been responsible for everything."
3423,"That certainly appears to be the case. But as long as we keep defeating monsters, something like this could happen again..."
3424,""
3425,"Um, although I had the one to defeat him, I do wish that he could rest in peace."
3426,""
3427,"Now we can continue on."
3428,"The number of specters has also grown; wouldn't that be a problem?"
3429,"It should be fine."
3430,"For something that we can't touch or eat, the best thing to do is just ignore them and move on."
3431,""
3432,"The Pumpking huh..."
3433,"I heard he would grow especially strong during this time of the year."
3434,"Is that what the Goddess said?"
3435,"Yes, that's right."
3436,"But I didn't know he could manipulate the specters."
3437,"Could it be somehow related to his hatred for us?"
3438,"Dunno. Perhaps we'll learn more when we get to the Pumpking."
3439,""
3440,"So the Pumpking actually created the castle."
3441,"And peace has been restored to the forest and all the specters returned to their slumber."
3442,""
3443,"If they had stayed in their slumber, they wouldn't have been defeated."
3444,"If we haven't been defeating monsters like we did, this wouldn't have happened, right?"
3445,""
3446,"Don't forget that these fellows are on the side of the monsters that attacked us."
3447,"Hating us because we defended ourselves from them is their problem, not ours."
3448,"So the way to the castle has appeared."
3449,"Is it alright if we go on like this?"
3450,"I can't guarantee it, but it would be bad if the specters get to the Mansion, wouldn't it?"
3451,""
3452,"Yes."
3453,"So the only choice is to carry on, let's go."
3454,"The king of pumpkins that hates us and controls the specters huh..."
3455,"I never knew the Pumpking had such power."
3456,"It is possible that he didn't have the power originally."
3457,"Why?"
3458,"We have got to find the Pumpking no matter what and when we do, we shall find out."
3459,""
3460,"And what is twisted has been corrected."
3461,"The castle and the specters have all disappeared."
3462,"Once the twisted being that is the Pumpking has vanished, everything has been restored to their original state."
3463,""
3464,"Is the Pumpking an example of a twisted being?"
3465,"Even in death, he had assimilated the hatred of monsters and relied on that emotion to come back to life."
3466,"If that isn't a twisted being, I don't know what is."
3467,"So as long as we keep defeating monsters, a twisted being like that could appear once again."
3468,""
3469,"And my mission is to steer everything towards their rightful course. If a twisted being should appear, I will just keep fighting it."
3470,""
3471,"The more I look at it, the more uncomfortable I feel..."
3472,"It should stay dead now."
3473,"Hmm, the barrier is gone too. Let's carry on."
3474,"Did the Pumpking have this power to control the specters?"
3475,"As far as I am concern, I've never heard of it."
3476,"Which means if we don't find the Pumpking, we couldn't know for sure..."
3477,""
3478,"That seems to be the case."
3479,"The number of specters around the castle has increased too. Let's move on carefully."
3480,""
3481,"Grudge and wrath are terrible emotions... a mere pumpkin could become such monstrosity because of them."
3482,""
3483,"It is because we have defeated many monsters along the way that enabled him to assimilate so much hatred."
3484,""
3485,"But we can't just keep running away from monsters that attack us."
3486,""
3487,"So would he come back to life again?"
3488,"Possibly, but there's no way we can prevent it from happening."
3489,"What a sticky situation."
3490,"What an unnerving fellow... stay dead and be gone!"
3491,"The way to the castle has appeared."
3492,"And there are hordes of specters ahead of us...it is spooky everywhere."
3493,"Hey, let's get going already; I don't want to stay in a place like this."
3494,""
3495,"What a load of nonsense! They were the ones to attack first."
3496,""
3497,"I didn't expect us to be hated so much..."
3498,"Rather than wasting time to feel dispirited, we should get going. Looks like the Pumpking is behind all these."
3499,""
3500,"That should make the Pumpking powerless."
3501,"Peace has been restored to the forest. So it was the Pumpking that had been manipulating the specters."
3502,""
3503,"I have beaten him thoroughly and it would be bad if he doesn't disappear now."
3504,""
3505,"But he became what he was due to the hatred and wrath of the monsters we had defeated."
3506,""
3507,"So the more monsters we take out, the more hatred he has for us."
3508,""
3509,"So, that means the Pumpking might appear again?"
3510,"Who knows? But if he does, I'll just slash him into pieces once more."
3511,""
3512,"Had it been possessed by the specters or was it the will of the swede itself?"
3513,""
3514,"What are you doing?"
3515,"Oh, I am just making my observation; it could be related to the influx of specters."
3516,""
3517,"Aren't we going forward?"
3518,"We will get going once I am done with this one. We are not in a hurry are we?"
3519,""
3520,"Because of my own profession, I am used to be hated. But I have got to say the hatred I felt this time is really intense."
3521,"Looks like the Druid really hates us."
3522,"Then again, I have lost count on the number of monsters we have defeated so far."
3523,"Perhaps the Pumpking had unleased the specters with the power of hatred that came from all the monsters we have defeated so far."
3524,""
3525,"What to do...."
3526,"I guess we've got to find the Pumpking and look for the solution."
3527,"Let's go."
3528,"It's truly frightening what could happen when an existence is no longer bound by its physical vessel."
3529,"Look at what he was capable of doing with sheer will alone."
3530,"In other words, something like the Pumpking might happen again?"
3531,""
3532,"As long as we keep defeating monsters like this, we will never be able to solve the problem completely."
3533,""
3534,"Nonetheless, we've got to get to the Goddess."
3535,"And now that we've made up our minds, let's be prepared for what could happen and move on."
3536,""
3537,"That is a gross design."
3538,"Looks like it won't be moving again."
3539,"The barrier is now gone. Let's hurry and get out of here...there's no guarantee that it will stay dead indefinitely."
3540,""
3541,"The king of pumpkins that could manipulate the specters..."
3542,"Although I have heard about the Pumpking, I didn't know he had powers like that."
3543,""
3544,"They appear to hate us with a passion, perhaps that's got something to do with it."
3545,""
3546,"Is that so?"
3547,"We should find out soon enough when we get to the Pumpking."
3548,"Apparently it is intense hatred and grudge that have boosted the Pumpking's power."
3549,""
3550,"So this is what would happen when the hatred and grudge of monsters are allowed to build up over time?"
3551,""
3552,"Yes."
3553,"And it would become a twisted being that defies fate."
3554,"And so its demise by our hands would also be inevitable."
3555,"But if we keep defeating monsters, something like this could happen again, no?"
3556,""
3557,"It is possible."
3558,"But even so, we've got to defeat them and move on for the sake of our own goals."
3559,""
3560,"Although the barrier is gone, I see a horde of specters ahead of us."
3561,"Is it alright if we continue on like this?"
3562,"Hmmm... maybe?"
3563,"Sitting here and worrying about it is of no use; let's get going first."
3564,"Did we do anything to this fellow that we make him hate us this much?"
3565,"Did he just express his regret to the Pumpking?"
3566,"In other words, the Pumpking had been the culprit. But I didn't even know him!"
3567,""
3568,"I really don't remember having done anything to him."
3569,"Although I knew such monsters existed, but I myself don't know the reason."
3570,""
3571,"I guess we must go to the Pumpking to find out."
3572,"He could turn into that with just wrath and grudge? The pumpkins in this world are things one shouldn't mess with."
3573,""
3574,"So as long as we keep defeating monsters, the Pumpking will be able to collect more hatred?"
3575,""
3576,"Who knows?"
3577,"But I will be much happier if the incident has taught him a lesson."
3578,"Will it go so smoothly?"
3579,"It's no use dwelling on the negative thoughts! Let's get active and look forward!"
3580,""
3581,"So now we can move on again."
3582,"So it was that swede that created the barrier."
3583,"Great! That saved us some trouble. Let's carry on."
3584,"So they really hated us huh? But we were only trying to protect ourselves."
3585,""
3586,"The more monsters we defeat, the more specters will appear?"
3587,""
3588,"I guess we won't know until we meet the Pumpking."
3589,"But now that we have turned his henchman into this... I don't suppose we could have a decent conversation with the Pumpking."
3590,""
3591,"I think I can somewhat relate to the Pumpking's feelings."
3592,"Because you knew the rage of losing your companions, right?"
3593,"It's not as simple as that."
3594,"There are many emotions in this world that are blacker than coals and filthier than rags, and yet you can't do anything about them."
3595,"The Pumpking must have emotions like that."
3596,""
3597,"I don't quite understand."
3598,"What I do understand is that the Pumpking is susceptible to the influence of those emotions."
3599,""
3600,"I don't know about you, but I think it'd be better if you stay ignorant about those emotions."
3601,""
3602,"Although the barrier is gone now, the number of specters has been increasing."
3603,"Is it alright if we just move on like this?"
3604,"It will no doubt be dangerous; but we can't solve anything if we don't carry on."
3605,""
3606,"That much I am sure."
3607,"What do you know about the Pumpking as a monster?"
3608,"I recall a monster like that... but I didn't know he had the power to command the specters."
3609,""
3610,"Could it be some other monsters or one of his kins?"
3611,"Any way, we won't know anything unless we meet the Pumpking."
3612,""
3613,"So it was hatred that enabled the Pumpking to materialize?"
3614,""
3615,"It could be due to the fact that we have been defeating monsters."
3616,"Which means the congregation of emotions from each minor entity is powerful enough to create a castle."
3617,""
3618,"Perhaps such is the will and emotion that Master had wanted me to comprehend."
3619,""
3620,"This guy... he wouldn't come back to life again by being possessed, would he?"
3621,"It doesn't look like it will move again."
3622,"That's good."
3623,"Anyway the barrier is gone. Let's move on."
3624,"The Pumpking... is he so powerful?"
3625,"Well about that..."
3626,"At least I have never heard he had powers like that."
3627,""
3628,"Hmm, it looks like they really hate us very much. Could this be the reason?"
3629,""
3630,"You mean by relying on hatred alone, he could gain so much power?"
3631,"I only said it is possible."
3632,"And we will only know the answer when we meet the Pumpking directly."
3633,"Letting his rage go unchecked and eventually he could no longer contain it?"
3634,""
3635,"Is that because we have been defeating monsters?"
3636,"Be that as it may, we would be dead if we hadn't defended ourselves against the attacking monsters!"
3637,""
3638,"That is right."
3639,"But no matter how many times they come at us, I'll defeat them all. That said..."
3640,""
3641,"I still don't want something like this to happen again. I guess we could only pray..."
3642,""
3643,"Looks like he won't be moving again."
3644,"Really?"
3645,"Does this make you uncomfortable?"
3646,"The barrier is gone now. It'd be better if we leave this place soon."
3647,"A monster that could manipulate the specters? What sort of existence is the Pumpking exactly?"
3648,""
3649,"A gigantic monster with the appearance of a pumpkin."
3650,"Pumpkin? I am sorry I have no recollection of that item in my memory."
3651,"I might have known it in the past..."
3652,"We will find out when we meet the Pumpking."
3653,"I see. Well the number of specters has increased. Let's get going."
3654,"A singular will that granted a monster the power to bend the rules of nature?"
3655,"What intense hatred!"
3656,"So it could appear again, we don't know for certain."
3657,"Is it because we will be defeating more monsters along the way?"
3658,"That is part of the reason. But a strong desire could change the laws of nature as we know them."
3659,""
3660,"In this case, it happened in the form of the Pumpking."
3661,"There is no way we could predict what would be the tipping point for such things to happen."
3662,"What is twisted must be corrected. That is how I have been taught."
3663,"Fire! Fire! Keep firing!"
3664,"Whether you retreat or not, I will shoot either way!"
3665,"If everything has been a mistake, then it wouldn't matter if I destroy everything."
3666,"As long as I can bring happiness to Sister, no price will be too high to pay."
3667,"For the sake of Sister, I must take you out right here and now!"
3668,"If I destroy you now, would Sister feel a bit better?"
3669,"I want to grow stronger!"
3670,"I can fight in battle too! Come and see for yourself!"
3671,"I must become stronger."
3672,"If I win, would you please take a rest? Please!"
3673,"It's a good thing that you have such desire for improvement. Let me be your opponent."
3674,"Keep it down, will you? Alright, alright. I'll be your opponent for a bit."
3675,"The endless pursuit for power and strength... will it eventually lead to happiness?"
3676,"If I win, let's have a cup of tea together."
3677,"I only followed you because I couldn't remember anything"
3678,"But somehow I have been having this sickening feeling..."
3679,"What's the matter?"
3680,"Oh, no. It's nothing. Let's move on."
3681,"Ahahaha, now things have gotten interesting."
3682,"Does fighting monsters bring joy to you?"
3683,"Yes. I feel ecstatic when my bullets hit. Does that make me strange?"
3684,"He is just like you"
3685,"Like me?"
3686,"Well, without his master's command, he couldn't do anything."
3687,"That's the same for you, isn't it?"
3688,"Well, I am in no position to make such remark myself..."
3689,"Although it is probably of no use in this world"
3690,"But is the dragon content with just collecting it?"
3691,"I don't know. And... the treasures and dragon have turned into ashes."
3692,"Although I don't know heaven or hell awaits,"
3693,"what is the dragon intending to do with the treasures it had taken with it?"
3694,"Has the Goddess made you crazy too?"
3695,"Is that so? I am not sure myself."
3696,"Well then, let's go to the world above."
3697,"And then you will realize what sort of terrible things the Goddess has been doing to you."
3698,"Once you reach the world above, you will understand. You definitely will."
3699,"This fight isn't stopping just because I won, is it?"
3700,"Looks like it's time to get to work."
3701,"We are both busy, let's get it over with."
3702,"This job is mine, I will get it done no matter what it takes."
3703,"It doesn't seem like it but I'm a busy guy. Don't make it hard for me."
3704,"Even though we work together, it is still tough against AI ..."
3705,"Why don't we take this easy? It's just practice."
3706,"Master Salgado is fighting me personally, how honored."
3707,"Worry not, your assigned mission is going on smoothly."
3708,"Though it's just practice, I won't be off-guard."
3709,"Just try to be serious and get something done."
3710,"Everything is bet on this mission, don't you forget."
3711,"It's ok to proceed like this?"
3712,"Yes, I will guide you through."
3713,"Well..."
3714,"In this case, I will obey your orders first."
3715,"Monsters of this level are still fine."
3716,"I heard monsters will get tougher the further we go."
3717,"We must be on our guard."
3718,"Wow, are you serious?"
3719,"Well... I really think whoever picked me has made the wrong decision, is that ok?"
3720,"So this is what they call <evil>......"
3721,"I almost fell in love."
3722,"You too wanna be among the dead?"
3723,"No, that is not what I mean..."
3724,"Your words are really horrifying."
3725,"Oh no, should we hunt for the treasure before the dragon?"
3726,"Do you want the treasures?"
3727,"Treasures..."
3728,"Treat that as a <yes> for now."
3729,"This way that Goddess will be harmless."
3730,"What do you plan to do next?"
3731,"The Goddess has been cleansed."
3732,"She can't guide us any more."
3733,"Then you should go with me back to Earth to settle my business."
3735,"Just because I don't like to do things rough doesn't mean I am not good at it."
3736,"Fine; I guess I'd better put a little more effort into it."
3737,"Is everything a beneficial experience as long as there's meaning to it?"
3738,"If you ask which side I am on, I guess I am on the side that is fond of talking."
3739,"There's always going to be something that you never expect no matter what you do; it would be better if you accept the fact and learn to enjoy the situation."
3740,"I see; so this is the essence of the technology that has been left behind by that great one."
3741,"To remember or to forget; which one is better?"
3742,"Do you want me to fight with you? If you are fine with that, so am I."
3743,"I need memories...regardless of what it may bring."
3744,"All you need to do is to take this as part of the request."
3745,"What a freaky forest... Is this how things are going to be for the other places ahead of us?"
3746,"Although I know which direction we are headed, I have no idea of the scenery that will come."
3747,"There isn't much we can do if you have no idea of that."
3748,"Let's move on quickly."
3749,"Seriously? Attacking a woman with a child? Don't you think that's just a bit too much?"
3750,"That's also a part of the trial you must go through in order to return to the world above."
3751,"Don't you ever get tired of saying these things all the time?"
3752,"That is your own opinion. Never mind; it's just a waste of time."
3753,"Having so many men to serve you by your side in order to make yourself appear important..."
3754,"I just can't understand that."
3755,"That makes two of us."
3756,"Although you are a doll, this might still be too difficult for you to comprehend now."
3757,"Then again, if you understand all of that. It may imply an even bigger problem..."
3758,"No matter how much hatred he has targeted or how much blood he has spilled,"
3759,"Treasures are the sole purpose of existence for dragons."
3760,"I didn't know dragons would be motivated by such things."
3761,"But the thought of others losing their lives,"
3762,"I am not able to condone such a cause."
3763,"Although I have done it in order to save you,"
3764,"I have nevertheless damaged the doll that Master has created...that might have been a bad idea"
3765,"The Goddess has always been trapped in grudges."
3766,"This is the best action to take."
3767,"Is that so...?"
3768,"What you have said...makes me feel like I have been redeemed."
3769,"You can't provide what I really want, can you?"
3770,"Are you still mad at me for hunting you down?"
3771,"I don't want to fight with you."
3772,"Get off my back."
3773,"Although he acts like ordinary people, William is obviously a solider."
3774,"I'll find a way to stay with my sister."
3775,"Have your gear prepared?"
3776,"I have no time to hear what you say."
3777,"Let's continue the topic from that day!"
3778,"Just as expected, that doll is a weapon."
3779,"Although it sounds very interesting, "
3780,"I can't always get the beating. Prepare yourself."
3781,"You have to offer something equivalent for this deal."
3782,"This pretty dress will become dirty."
3783,"After I think of it, I will come home. "
3784,"Is digging a weapon? We should stay alert."
3785,"No matter what they say, I don't intend to follow"
3786,"If you join me, you can satisfy your desires."
3787,"I did not intend to be in the way. I just want to help you."
3788,"You can still rely on my strength."
3789,"You will regret someday if you do not take my advice."
3790,"It is very important to witness my power before you make any judgements."
3791,"Do you want to carry out research without any limitations?"
3792,"Should we make a beneficial deal next time?"
3793,"When you remember what your goal is, you can still come to rely on me."
3794,"Would you like to be disguised as ordinary people, even when you have extraordinary powers?"
3795,"If you don't get out of my way, I will not be lenient."
3796,"I am one of the Revolutionary Army and will not lose to you!"
3797,"Obviously I have no time to fight here."
3798,"I have to go back to my country. I can't lose here!"
3799,"No matter where I go, is fighting the only way of resolving conflicts?"
3800,"You look just like that guy, but how is this possible?"
3801,"What happened after the revolution? Do you know?"
3802,"Why are you staring at my face? Is there something on my face?"
3803,"I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry."
3804,"Is it ok to advance like us?"
3805,"We have no choice but advance."
3806,"...I cannot remember anything. I will just listen to you."
3807,"This is the first time I fought against monsters"
3808,"Oh really?"
3809,"But you fought like a veteran."
3810,"That's because my body remembers how to fight."
3811,"But now that I think of it, I have no idea why I know how to fight."
3812,"Even if they are the dead, I could not beat them."
3813,"Since the vampire was defeated, we don't have to beat the dead."
3814,"Oh really? I hope they rest in peace."
3815,"No matter where the weak live, the strong always ravage the weak.."
3816,""
3817,"The dragon may has its reasons."
3818,"No matter what its reasons are, never rob the weak."
3819,""
3820,"She just use her child for her own purposes."
3821,"Lady Goddess may have intended to do that at the beginning..."
3822,"Probably."
3823,"But that's what the obsessive and evil people may think."
3824,"I think we will never know."
3825,"Not bad, this is what I have been waiting for!"
3826,"Pain is temporary, I just can't guarantee if you will be well!"
3827,"Come and fight if you must, isn't it more interesting this way?"
3828,"I just wanna know the potential of humankind."
3829,"Days you don't get screamed at no matter what you do are sweet!"
3830,"It's good to show each other our research."
3831,"I am getting stronger too. Come on, let's fight. "
3832,"Even in a world like this, you are still an Observer?"
3833,"If only we can get some solid proof like this."
3834,"I'm only stuck with you to pass the time, you better make me feel entertained."
3835,"No matter which world we may be in, my destiny is the same."
3836,"Having no memory can be a pest."
3837,"What are you doing?"
3838,"Nothing, just checking some stuff out."
3839,"I will do as you said, don't worry."
3840,"Yay, this is rather fun!"
3841,"What makes you happy?"
3842,"What is this? I mean ALL!"
3843,"Relax your body, interesting stuff is everywhere."
3844,"There is nothing more enjoyable than this!"
3845,"Dead people are the best, no matter what you do to them, they won't get mad."
3846,"This is beyond rational."
3847,"Hook up whatever still works, let it move and get stronger."
3848,"Hook it up again and let it get stronger."
3849,"Ha! I'm so pumped up just thinking about it!"
3850,"Anywhere I can find a Dragon wrist or scale"
3851,"It is all dust now, I don't think you can find it."
3852,"Whoa~ A dragon as strong as this will make good research material."
3853,"No matter what comes along, find it!"
3854,"Well, the Goddess is defeated, you are saved."
3855,"Anything else you want to do?"
3856,"No... or should I say... I don't know what else to do..."
3857,"Well.Come to me."
3858,"Being able to make a Doll of Soul by yourself is very uncommon."
3859,"I won't do anything to upset you, don't worry."
3860,"Winners get snacks, how unthinkable."
3861,"I get this snack if I win? What a weird event."
3862,"If you want it, you'll have to get through me!"
3863,"Maybe it's kinda burnt, but you can still eat it."
3864,"This gift has me written all over it! Just kidding!"
3865,"Is this some Western thing? What an interesting event."
3866,"Of course you can have it if you win, but is it only the cookie you want?"
3867,"Cookies or whatever. Even if there is no fight, I will give you whatever you want."
3868,"Pardon me, but I will be your opponent."
3869,"We are on the same mission, can't we join forces?"
3870,"If this fight is inevitable, I will give it my all to not embarrass myself."
3871,"It's been too long since I have had a good old brawl, hope you are ready."
3872,"I must fight to keep my promise with my friends."
3873,"I didn't expect a fight with Archibald, now I'm scared."
3874,"If I can get back to the Land with you, I..."
3875,"Looks like you expect too much from me."
3876,"It will be better if you treat this duel as training back on the Land."
3877,"Watch where your leg is, you don't wanna fall."
3878,"Don't worry about me."
3879,"Compared to that, we better get moving."
3880,"Ah... Ok, I got it."
3881,"I got some memory back, though only a bit of it"
3882,"So that's it..."
3883,"You are not reacting... I don't know what to do."
3884,"Will I get used to it after some time?"
3885,"I never imagined I would be forced into a fight with a Vampire."
3886,"I have been startled with all sorts of unbelievable things since I've been here."
3887,"What does that mean?"
3888,"Isn't the existence of Vampires unbelievable?"
3889,"There are still a lot of monsters in the Land."
3890,"But Vampires are still a thing in fairy tales."
3891,"At...at last, I win."
3892,"Your voice is trembling, are you alright?"
3893,"Now you saw the embarrassing side of me."
3894,"Because in the past, I wouldn't have had a chance"
3895,"to fight something so strong and terrifying."
3896,"It's a miracle I won, isn't it?"
3897,"Though it's all for saving you,"
3898,"but defeating the Goddess means..."
3899,"How do I get back to the Land?"
3900,"The almighty Goddess has been cleansed, she is with me now."
3901,"So I should be able to bring you back to the Land."
3902,"Well... Let's go."
3903,"If you have nowhere else to go, why not join me?"

3996,"I'm the first of the Punishers, back off if you want to live."
3997,"Has anyone ever taught you about getting punished for doing something wrong?"
3998,"There is nothing tricky about this doll. Just kidding."
3999,"Do not hate me even when you are defeated, I have my reasons."
4000,"Many have died with regrets, but I'm not in the position to comment."
4001,"You see? Bad guys everywhere no matter where I go."
4002,"I sort of cannot control my power."
4003,"I will show you the tough side of a Doll!"
4004,"Even in this world, you must not bewitched by love."
4005,"Now is a good chance to show you the difference between a Doll and an Automaton."
4006,"It is good to have some strength, but it is still worrisome."
4007,"Feeling insecure about not being able to control your power? Let me help."
4008,"Which is stronger when pitted against my Thallium blade? Let's find out!"
4009,"Veronica, I know. It's... ok..."
4010,"I just knew I hate autonomous Automatons."
4011,"I will be ok! I can go solo!"
4012,"You, how did you move?"
4013,"Can you show me?"
4014,"No."
4015,"If you must know, go ask the Goddess."
4016,"Will it kill you just to show me? You wimp!"
4017,"The creatures of this world, are they automatons like you?"
4018,"Isn't this world created by the Goddess?"
4019,"I don't know, she doesn't talk about it much."
4020,"In that case... Where do those creatures come from?"
4021,"What about those that stayed?"
4022,"Do all you aliens with human faces look so gorgeous?"
4023,"You got an opinion on them being beautiful?"
4024,"No, I do not mean that."
4025,"You both are dolls. Theirs are perfect"
4026,"but mines is flawed which gets me upset."
4027,"Hmm, I do not know what to say."
4028,"It is a dragon this time, this world is full of excitement."
4029,"Is it? I do not understand."
4030,"Everything is the first-time for you. You won't understand."
4031,"I have seen a lot in my life, but nothing this spectacular."
4032,""
4033,"Now that we have beaten that twisted fellow..."
4034,"Are you ok?"
4035,"Looks like I'm ok."
4036,"Even the Goddess is cleansed by you."
4037,"Cleansed?"
4038,"It may sound weird, but if the Goddess has lost her power,"
4039,"then just forget about it."
4040,"Hi, Miss! How about a cup of tea when it's all over? Can I?"
