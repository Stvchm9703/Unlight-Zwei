1,6,1,"Year 3395. - Quagmire -",1,"It started to snow. The ground under enemy fire turned into mud and it made Evarist's foots dirty.<br>
The battle field against Burnside and Imperroda, on the east side of Empire had been deadlocked for a while.<br>
Izac came closer and mutters.<br>
“We're set up, huh?” His grimy battle ware shows the violence of this war.<br>
Izac says with teasing tone. He has smile on his face.<br>
“I knew it.” Evarist says. “Need to make some sacrifices for obtain anything.”<br>
“Sacrifices you said? Well...Your men will receive my sympathy”<br>
“You are the one of my men, also, Izac.”<br>
“Well...In that way, I'm enjoying being your man.” Izac says. “I love to be in battle field”<br>
“It's going to be more fun....Look”<br>
As Evarist said, Izac turned his sight over bulwark and he nodded.<br>
“Can you see that? Izac?”<br>
Some of hurried enemy soldiers recognized over bulwark of enemy side over the bridge.<br>
They apparently have different equipments than others.<br>
“Reinforcements? Maybe?” Izac says.<br>
“That's Army of Imperroda, for sure. I saw some [War Beasts] there...”<br>
Evarist made up his mind to tell Izac about the order from General Schidor at this point.<br>
|<br>
|<br>
- Phaydo the Imperial City -<br>
|<br>
General put his cup and says,<br>
“Anxiety....That's the word for me”<br>
“There are so many of useless soldiers in my army......”<br>
General had chosen Evarist to be one of his favorite men ever since Evarist distinguished himself in imperial army.<br>
“I am counting on you, Captain Waltz.”<br>
General had authority of himself in his sharp eyes.<br>
“In precise, I am counting on you as a fighter more than as a commander.”<br>
|<br>
Once, General Schidor was the special person for Empire.<br>
He was the man who argued to reinforce the Empire's military strength to expand territory, when the [Dawn-light Age], the time many lands released from the evil whirlpool [Profound], had started. His dramatic achieved of war results raised dignity of Empire.<br>
However, too much of his success made his position imperiled.<br>
Also, seesaw battle in Western frontline, against Lubiana Kingdom, gives a negative influence towards his political strength in the army.<br>
|<br>
“I heard that you was not born in territory of Empire. Where are you from?”<br>
General said to Evarist. General usually gathers his men to dinner, which meant as strategy meeting in this case, however, this time, Evarist was the only one who is invited.<br>
“I was born in Forest Hill, sir. It does not exist anymore. It swallowed into the whirlpool [Profound], when I was little. ”<br>
Evarist honestly answered general's question. It is unnecessary for him to lie general unless he knows what general has in his mind.<br>
“I grew up as refugee. I was age of 17 when I joined imperial army, sir.”<br>
“What was the reason to join in the army?”<br>
“I wanted to prove myself, sir. I had a strong desire to comprehend my limit.”<br>
General was looking into the eyes of Evarist while he was listening.<br>
“I see...” General nodded and asked,<br>
“How do you feel yourself about your origin?”<br>
“I have no sympathy for myself, sir. Emotion is only incidental factor of behavior, I believe. There is no need to be adherence to emotion if I am constantly progressing, sir.”<br>
“What the interesting opinion you have. That is what makes you to be a dependable commander, I assume.”<br>
General took his cup.<br>
“General, may I ask you the reason of this convocation, sir?”<br>
Evarist broached a point-blank question to general after a short silence.<br>
“Do not be in hurry, son. Now listen.....”<br>
“There is no absolute purpose of life. It does not matter where we bone, or whatever we do, we shall die at the end of the life.” He continued.<br>
“However, war has an absolute purpose. Do you know what it is? It is a purpose to defeat the enemy. That is the reason why I live with it.”<br>
General get's up from his chair and started to walk towards war map, hanged on the wall.<br>
“The battle line expands in each day after day. To the west, to the east, and also to the south. Everywhere, son. Everywhere.”<br>
The eyes of general started to have intense aspiration.<br>
“We, the imperial army of Granddillenia Empire, will win in each battle. We will defeat every single enemy. The war never ends untill we have an absolute victory!”<br>
The room became in silence after his speech. Evarist understood that aspiration, almost of insanity, brought this little old man to the position where he is at.<br>
“In order to do so, I need you, son”<br>
Passionate voice of general broke the silence.<br>
“Do me a favor. A favor which can be done by only a man like you...”<br>
|<br>
|<br>
- Borderland of Myocca -<br>
|<br>
The dawn has come.<br>
Three war beasts started to appear. Their height is almost up to 3 alle (15 feet), and so as their width. A force of gigantic body can be felt even in long distance. Imperrodian soldiers, holding reins from metal shackles set to the mouth of the war beast, rides on the back of the war beast. A type of that war beast has been researched during last night. It called as [Toebear]. It generally walks in four legs; however, it can use its forefoot for predation. Its red hard skin as carapace and great healing ability gives an excellent talent to be as war beast.<br>
War beasts slowly advanced to the bridge and they were dragging defensive barrier. In a meanwhile, pioneer of Burnside started to cross the bridge with no fear of being fired. Those Burnsidian pioneers started to eliminate the mines and obstacles which set by Granddillenian forces.<br>
Even though, both Burnside and Imperroda does not have a strong connections to [Engineer], who supervise technology , as Granddlillenia Empire does, they manage to own defensive barrier for own protection. However, unlike Granddlillenia Empire, they were not able to use Automata or high-performance field guns.<br>
|<br>
Unit of knights already assembled in the camp. Evarist's orderly man waits his master right beside his mechanical auto-horse. Evarist rode his auto-horse, received his gun, and checked cartridge. Right after he puts gun away into a saddle, every knights in his unit had finished riding their own auto-horse.<br>
After confirming preparation of his unit, Evarist pulled out his sword to the air and shouted.<br>
“The main force of our imperial force is currently under the battle against Lubianians! The cowardly Burnsidian force invaded this battle line of Myocca to take an advantage of this situation! This is absolute insult! An insult which noble knight like every single one of you here would never can think of!”<br>
He continues with the eye burned with anger.<br>
“They also brought Imperrodian with evil disgusting war beasts! We can't withdraw our eyes from those baseness bastards! ”<br>
“For our brother fight in western land! For the family waits back in motherland! We shall exterminate morale of foolish Imperrodian!”<br>
Unit members started to cheer wildly.<br>
“Do not fear evil war best! Fear to be dishonored!”<br>
All of the fear and anxiety disappeared from unit member.<br>
“Okay boys! Let's get started!!”<br>
Izac, adjutant of the unit, shouted out. He was standing beside of Evarist.<br>
“Well, it's going to be a fun time...ha-ha”<br>
“That is an idle talk, lieutenant. Be like my quiet orderly man here. ”<br>
Surprised orderly man who kept quiet shows shocked face to Evarist.<br>
“Oops. Got yelled at. Scary, isn't he?”<br>
Izac smiled to poor strained orderly man<br>
|<br>
Knights launched out from the base. Auto horse ran mined battle field like wind. It was just like dancing, the way they avoid obstacles placed by own army. Only [Engineer] will be able to create automata with such a precise movement.<br>
Burnsidian pioneers jumped away from obstacle they were trying to eliminate and started to run into the other side of river. However, auto-horse catches them up real quick and crushed them into the ground. Crushed pioneers rolled on the ground as old rag.<br>
|<br>
Burnsidian ware beast rider attempted to release war beast from metal shackles to oppose raging auto-horse.<br>
As soon Evarist saw it, he pulled out his gun and aimed to war beast rider. Distance between them was more than 50 alle (240 feet), however, Evarist was starting to capture swaying target precisely.<br>
|<br>
He felt stream of time getting slow down. Now he knows it is the right timing to use his special talent. The vision of enemy came in to his sight clearly. Swaying muzzle synchronized with the vision of the future. He pulled a trigger when he captured the future vision of falling enemy.<br>
Rider of war beast passed away, hanging down from saddle.<br>
Evarist shot down two remained riders, in the same way.<br>
“Well done! Captain!”<br>
Orderly man cheers. He seems to have recovered from being strained by seeing elimination of the war beast. He was staying in the back of battle field with Evarist.<br>
“Just move on. The main battle will be after crossing the bridge.”<br>
Evarist started to move forward with his orderly man. [Toebear], the war beast did not pay any attentions to Evarist. It thought its task is over because the one who gives order is now hanging down from saddle without any of vital signs.<br>
“It's just like a cart horse, like this”<br>
Orderly man shouted in excited tone.<br>
|<br>
The vanguards had been stopped by machine-gun fire at the area of defensive barrier.<br>
Guardians of defensive barrier fired machine- gun continually, not to let auto horses get closer.<br>
Evarist found Izac hiding behind the shade.<br>
“What's wrong, Izac?” Evarist asked.<br>
“Can't move. They have a nice formation here” Izac answers.<br>
“We do not have much time. Two of us can make difference, right? Let's go.”<br>
Evarist said to Izac. Izac nodded with smile.<br>
“You. You come with us. We'll eliminate that machine-gun.” Evarist said to orderly man.<br>
Two side attacks, is the plane Evarist came up. If two men launched out from the shade both the right side and left side, either of the man will reach to machine-gun for sure. In order to defeat main force of enemy, they could not waste the time here.<br>
“GO! GO! GO!!”<br>
Three men launched out from the shade.<br>
Shooter of machine-gun showed a bit of confusion, than he decided to aim to Evarist.<br>
Evarist took low position on auto-horse to use it as a shield. Auto-horse will be able to endure couple of gun shots. He will not die unless he gets shot in his body.<br>
After the sound of gun fire Evarist received massive impact. Auto-horse lost its control<br>
, and leaned forward to the ground. Evarist flew in the air and slammed to the ground.<br>
He struggles with the pain, however he had to get up quickly to avoid been crushed by following forces.<br>
It seems that Izac had eliminated machine gun. Following forces was passing Evarist skillfully.<br>
“Are you alright? Captain!”<br>
Orderly man came closer and says,<br>
“Need to change horse”<br>
“It is fine. Let me ride on your back.”<br>
Luckily, Evarist did not have any injuries. He obtained gun from his orderly man and gets up on the back of auto-horse<br>
|<br>
After crossing 2/3 of the bridge, Evarist recognized heavy armed soldiers launching out from enemy base at the other side of the bridge.<br>
Well trained heavy armed force was one of the dangerous opponents of auto-horses.<br>
From on top of auto-horse, Evarist aimed to a soldier with commander mark. He pulled the trigger. Firing hammer knocked detonator. Armor piercing ammunition accelerated its momentum by intense pressure of gas shot out from barrel.<br>
Every sensation connected together inside of Evarist. Like it meant be as part of enemy soldier's face, the bullet sucked into slit on soldier's helmet. Captain felt down. Not many enemies noticed what happened.<br>
When Evarist aimed for the next target, Izac showed up in his sight.<br>
|<br>
Izac, on the ground now, was slaying down enemies. Heavy armed soldiers will not be able to catch up to his quickness. An obvious confusion could easily feel from enemy forces.<br>
Evarist jumped off from auto-horse and pulled out his sword. He decided to fight here with Izac to keep enemies in this area so that he can send another forces to the front.<br>
Enemy force started to rout when they saw defeat of war beasts and heavy armed soldiers.<br>
Evarist expected the end of this ware with confidence when he saw Izac giving a final blow to one of enemy soldiers.<br>
Huge loss in this battle, however, they got what they want.<br>
Soldiers like them have to fight to obtain their wish.<br>
That is the only way.<br>
Determination of Evarist will not be changed, even in bloody battle field.<br>

2,36,1,"Year 3395. - The Fierce God -",1,"A man on the driving seat turned around to check situations behind of his carriage.<br>
Monsters which had been following his carriage, started to attack all at once.<br>
He speeded up his auto- horse; however, the distance between them gets shortened each time he looked back.<br>
He shook his head to get rid of a bad image. Then he turned back his head forward to find the way to escape.<br>
Suddenly he sees a man, with blond hair and blue eyes just like the sky, standing on the way. Unlike his orderly face, his body seemed to be well trained as one of the ancient warrior statue.<br>
“Hey! You!! It's dangerous here!! Monsters are attacking me!!!”<br>
Driver shouted has hard as he could.<br>
Even though driver's shout had been muted by sound of rolling weal, a mysterious man responded to it.<br>
He pulled out his sword with heavy sound, and he rushed into the carriage.<br>
Then he jumped on the roof of fast running carriage. After landing, he kept going on the roof, then raged into group of monsters. It happened in very short period of the time so the driver could not figure out what exactly happened.<br>
When driver looked back, mysterious man was fighting against group of monsters by himself.<br>
There were 5 of monster corpse already.<br>
“Oh, boy! Killed that many monsters already?”<br>
A plan came up in driver's head when he said that.<br>
|<br>
A mysterious man named Abel, slayed the first monster by using the momentum of jumping off from carriage roof. Then he made a high- speed turn with sword sticking out. That movement blew couple of monsters off.<br>
Then he crushed head of monster which was trying to jump on to him.<br>
Now monsters stated wincing for a moment.<br>
|<br>
Those monsters had the shapes of both lizard and wolf. Yet it is carnivorous monster, they would only eat smaller monsters or animals. Humans had barely attacked by them.<br>
Disappearance of chaotic whirlpool [Profound] caused decreasing numbers of monsters. It means the food source of that monster was decreasing also. That might be a reason why that monster attacked carriage. They were longing for food.<br>
|<br>
“Maybe we have something in common, huh?”<br>
Abel showed some sympathy towards those chaotic monsters eaten away by parallel world.<br>
“However!”<br>
Monsters started to attack again. Survival instinct of those monsters made them to attack from both sides.<br>
--Right one is bit faster!<br>
The sharpened five senses of Abel gave himself incredible response to avoid that attack. He twisted his body to dodge the attack from the right side. By keeping that momentum, he slayed two monsters at the same time.<br>
Unintentional smile showed on his face. Adrenalin in his brain gave him enhancement. His sight became all in white. Only [Himself] and [Enemy] was in there.<br>
Now the wasteland turned into a battle field.<br>
And Abel turned as “The Fierce God.”<br>
|<br>
“Wow! Look at the mess here. Can't you be a little nicer?”<br>
That voice brought Abel back from trance.<br>
Abel turns around to direction that voice came from.<br>
There was driver of carriage, ride on auto- horse, coming closer. He would be slayed by Abel if he gets any closer when Abel was on trance.<br>
Abel started to look around to make sure every single monster is dead using his sharpened senses.<br>
When he made sure nothing is moving around, he asked to that driver,<br>
“What you want?”<br>
Driver started to laugh loudly.<br>
“HA-HA. What I want? Huh? That's the funny one. Well I'm here to hire you.”<br>
“You......hire me?”<br>
“Well, yeah. I want have someone can fight like that as guard of our caravan. Oh I can't pay you right now, but don't worry. I'll pay you good when we arrived to Meriguadia.”<br>
Meriguadia Kingdom, ruled by [Over Lord] Batista, is located far away from here, Abel thought. Why would the caravans of Meriguadia wondering around this place near the Imperroda? Abel started to think in deeply.<br>
“Oh. I guess you are thinking why we're wondering around here, huh? Well you know Meriguadia and Imperroda allied couple month ago, right? And new trading route had set up. We are on the way back of our first trade. Then I attacked by monster and you helped me! Well, I was amazed by how strong you are! Nice fight! Nice fight there!!”<br>
Abel knew that guy did not see that battle at all. This trader just flatters Abel to make him feel good to be caravan guard.<br>
However, that did not work with Abel.<br>
“Shut your mouth for a bit, will you?”<br>
“Oops sorry, sorry. My mouth flatters by itself. Sucks to be a dealer, huh? OK, how about this. I'll give you a lot of food. We have enough storage for you to get stuffed every day. How is that sound? ”<br>
Able noticed that remaining of his food is almost empty. He thought for a moment, and made up his mind.<br>
“OK. I'm on.”<br>
“There you go! Get on the horse!”<br>
When Abel put his foot on the step, he asked,<br>
“What you are going to do if I decided to attack you guys.”<br>
“Nope. That's not going to be happened”<br>
Trader grins.<br>
“You are not the kind of guy who commits robbery. You are kind of guy just longing for a fight. Am I right?”<br>
An analysis of trader surprised Abel. That trader seems to have sharp observant eye.<br>
“Never underrate traders, huh?”<br>
Abel smiled in a different way than the smile during the battle.<br>
|<br>
A couple of the day passed after meeting of Meriguadian caravan.<br>
Travel was safe. They had been attacked by some monsters, but Able killed them all.<br>
The only complain Abel had is the bed. The bed in carriage was awful. He slept during a day because he was guarding caravan during a night. He tried to sleep in running carriage; however, it was hard for him to sleep on that awful bed.<br>
Maybe that was the reason why Abel had a nightmare today...<br>
He is dreaming of his past, the past which he would never want to bring back.<br>
|<br>
[In the Night mare]<br>
“What are you doing? Kill him! Now!”<br>
The bloodshot eye, the eyes of insanity which is seeking for absolute might, was staring at Abel.<br>
He pulled his sword down and said,<br>
“I have already defeated him. Also Nicolas will be a good fighter if we continue to train him”<br>
“You still do not understand”<br>
Father of Abel, Oswald Townsend was walking close to him.<br>
“What is the swords man? What is the might?”<br>
Before this duel against little brother Nicholas, Oswald said this is the formal duel. It meant as the duel to decide formal successor of [Instructor of Swordplay] for Lubiana Kingdom. That is what Oswald wanted to mention.<br>
“I will ask you again! What is the swords man? What is the might?”<br>
Oswald pulled out Abel's sword and handed to Abel's hand.<br>
“Now this is the answer!”<br>
“No! Father!!!”<br>
Abel forced to swing his sword downward in to Nicolas.<br>
“Agh!”<br>
Blood of Nicolas splashed. It was obvious to anyone that it was the life ending stroke.<br>
“Please!! Please stop! Father! My little brother is going to die!!”<br>
“That's right! Nicolas was weak swords man! That is why he is dying now!! Now Abel! You are the winner! You will be my successor!!”<br>
Abel felt the end of Nicholas in his hand. However, Oswald did not release Abel. Then body of Nicholas stopped twitching.<br>
“Nicholas!!!!!!!!!!!”<br>
Something in Abel had exploded. Unexpected force came out from the bottom of his body. He released himself from Oswald and swung his sword to his own father.<br>
It was a fast powerful stroke. Even the trained swords man will not be able to dodge. However, the number one swords man of the Kingdom avoided Abel's deadly blow.<br>
“Ha-ha. That was a nice stroke. Become much stronger. That is what the swords man is all about.”<br>
“AGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGUH”<br>
Abel's did not care about anything.<br>
I will kill this man--<br>
That was the only thing he could think of. Only the [enemy] was in his sight.<br>
Everything turned in to white in his sight.<br>
|<br>
When Abel realized, his whole body was covered by blood. He had scars everywhere in his body.<br>
Then he found his father lay down in the pound of blood.<br>
Dead body of Nicolas lay down beside of Abel.<br>
“Oh I killed them....”<br>
That is what Able was thinking at the end of this tragedy.<br>
|<br>
|<br>
Abel woke up slowly.<br>
“What happened? Had a nightmare or something?”<br>
A trader who brought Abel to this caravan said.<br>
“Yup....Really bad one”<br>
Abel jumps off from carriage.<br>
“Hey! Where are you going?”<br>
“It's my work time.”<br>
Abel said shortly, and pulled out his sword.<br>
A group of monster was outraging to caravan.<br>

A young woman had passed away on cold stone road.<br>
The body of women had been ripped from shoulder to center of her body. Blood floated on stone road.<br>
Grunwald, standing beside of dead body, was looking into the face of woman.<br>
Blood over floating from woman's mouth, was shining clearly in the darkness of the night.<br>
Grunwald stood there for a while. Black hood was hiding his expression.<br>
After a while, a man with black clothes disappeared as ghost.<br>
There was no moonshine.<br>
|<br>
|<br>
- In the Castle of Blownhide -<br>
|<br>
“...So what?”<br>
The word of prince froze the air of the room.<br>
Face of Grunwald showed no expressions at all as it is actually frozen.<br>
“The tragedy occurred in capital city, is now fearing our subjects....So please...Please...”<br>
Sir Gaius, who served for kingdom with royalty, lost his ward at the end.<br>
|<br>
This young prince, Grunwald is ruling Lonsbrough Kingdom as proxy of the illness old king. Now the proxy of the king accused of murder by one of the servant.<br>
No one ever had heard situation like this in the history of Lonsbrough Kingdom.<br>
|<br>
There were two elder brothers of Grunwald. However, they both passed away in young.<br>
Grunwald came back to kingdom a couple years ago, after been ejected by the king.<br>
His strange personality and behavior caused himself of ejection.<br>
Since childhood, he corrected dead animals. He buried them under the ground, and took bones out to use it as ornament in his room. He also wanted to have executed prisoner body.<br>
Servants in castle gossiped about him, saying that he is cursed child. No one even wanted to get close to him. He never stopped his strange behavior even after being rebuked by his brother or the king.<br>
He ejected by the king when he was 14 years old. Many of dead body, assumed to be victims of the weird prince, found in cellar.<br>
At the day of ejection, the king asked many times about the reason why he killed people and the reason why he does such a strange behaviors. Grunwald totally ignored the king. That is how Grunwald ejected.<br>
|<br>
“I will have to report this to the king. Sir”<br>
Sir Gaius said in distress tone. Sir Gaius believed that years of ejection had not changed weird prince at all.<br>
“Excuse me. May I join?”<br>
Rofen, an old scholar served kingdom for long time, came in to strained room.<br>
His eyes still remains a visage of being world famous engineer; even he is at the age of 80.<br>
“We are all in anxiety. What Sir. Gaius saying is, “quit your weird behavior.” ”<br>
Because of Rofen served kingdom from two generations back, he is allowed to speak to the king or prince in personal way.<br>
“Rumor that Granddillenia raising its army reached to this capital city. There are lots of schemes going around from nation to nation.”<br>
“Now is the time of change. The world has released from the wheel of Chaos. Each nation will start to raise their army. The fire of the war will cover the entire nations, so as our nation will be.”<br>
Rofen took deep bless and looked around servants.<br>
“Please understand their royalty.”<br>
|<br>
The expression of Grunwald was still freezing even after hearing Rofen's word.<br>
Servants started to step out from in front of the prince with disconsolately expression. They could not stand to be in the room anymore.<br>
Rofen, the last one to leave the room, whispered.<br>
“The light and shadow...It clearly show up under the blight sunlight, doesn't it.”<br>
|<br>
|<br>
- Back Alley -<br>
|<br>
Grunwald sneaked out from castle during night.<br>
It was not hard for him to do because he knew about all of the secret passage to the town. Hidden passage or underground prison was the peaceful place of lonely prince back in his childhood.<br>
Grunwald sensed a desire, desire of [something], rankles deep inside of him when he inhaled moisten night air. He closed his eyes for a while to have a taste of that desire.<br>
Then he put his hood on.<br>
|<br>
He leaned against the wall in shadow, when he came to street where the bars and prostitutes are gathering. He started to gaze at street. Sometime drunken prostitute and her companion passed in front Grunwald, however, he had ever being noticed.<br>
He waited for the time in quiet. Then he saw a woman coming out from bar walking to the other side of street. Grunwald slowly gets out from alley and started to sneak after that woman.<br>
|<br>
As turning away from the lights of main streets, she walked into dark alley where the light of town barely shines.<br>
The dark shadow appeared and started to sneak after her as soon as she walked into dark ally.<br>
She did not notice it at all. Shadow was getting closer and closer. Yet, she still does not notice it. The shadow made its attacking position when it reached the back of woman. Poor women still does not know what is going to be happened to her.<br>
The shadow brought sword up, and swung sword down.<br>
A sound of metallic collision occurred.<br>
After metallic sound, sword of shadow was on the ground. Two shadows were facing each other.<br>
Finally, the woman noticed the shadow. She screamed once and started to run away.<br>
|<br>
Standing shadow was Grunwald, with sword.<br>
The man attempted to attack woman jumped away to avoid secondary attack.<br>
They both seem to have the same height, and they both were wearing the same cloth.<br>
“I was looking for you.” Grunwald said to the man.<br>
The man noticed his opponent is the weird prince. The man, in fighting position, put his hand on to button of his upper cloth. By looking at his movement, Grunwald could easily tell the man had been well trained.<br>
“Before you pull out anything, think about...”<br>
Grunwald spoke to the man.<br>
“What is your desire?”<br>
The man ignored that question.<br>
He took away his upper cloth and pulled about gun.<br>
Before the man fires his gun his head came off from his body by the beauty of Grunwald's sword skill. Remain body of the man fell down. It was still holding a gun in the hand. Fresh blood covered the ground. Grunwald had instant smile on his face.<br>
The peaceful silence of the night had come back.<br>
Grunwarld stands up with head of the man, folded with his cloth, in his hand<br>
|<br>
|<br>
- In the Basement -<br>
|<br>
Light was shining through the door. Grunwald opened the door vigorously.<br>
Then he saw Rofen sits down with many of weird machines.<br>
“Well...Well. This is a sudden visit.”<br>
Old wise man raised his head from huge magnifying glass.<br>
“Have question to this one.”<br>
Grunwald put the head of a man on a messy table.<br>
“Ah...You are going to do that again? It will bring back my old memories.”<br>
Ominous vigor showed up in Rofen's eyes.<br>
“This is not for your experimentation. This is murderer.”<br>
“Oh. Is that so? Hmm. So which means that murder was not done by you, huh? Well, this is unexpected.”<br>
Old man slowly stood up.<br>
“Stop making stupid jokes. Hurry up. Head's going to be rotten.”<br>
“I know. I know...well where did I put it?”<br>
Rofan started pushing his piled up books and weird machines aside.<br>
Grunwald slapped out junks on the long chair and sat on it.<br>
Then he started thinking in deep to figure out how to solve this situation.<br>

4,16,1,"Year 3396. - Dog eat Dog -",1,"Izac shot the head of a man.<br>
Bullet through man's head splashed blood in the room.<br>
It was a quick gun shooting of Izac which even Evarist could not notice.<br>
The man said he was sent by General Schidor.<br>
Even though, it was late night when he arrived, Evarist, the owner of house, invited him inside the house.<br>
|<br>
“Assassination, huh?”<br>
Izac pulled the dead man off from chair, and started search his body.<br>
After a few seconds, Izac found dynamites, enough to blow entire room, under upper cloth of dead man.<br>
Izac took out those dynamites from dead body, and pulled detonating fuse off.<br>
“How did you notice?” Evarist asked.<br>
“Smells. That dynamite has unique smells.” Izac, still searching dead body, said.<br>
Evarist started to look into dynamites in his hand, thinking who will be the client of this assassin. Exploding house of high officer of imperial force will give a high risk to client, also.<br>
|<br>
“No fireworks this time, huh?” Evarist said frankly. He talks like this in private time, only with Izac.<br>
“Oh. That hurts my feeling...I love fireworks.” Izac answered jokingly, and continued,<br>
“Any guess who is in charge of this cancelled firework?”<br>
“Nope. So many suspects are there.” Evarist showed ironic smile in his face.<br>
“Wow, that's nice.” Izac said, and he continues searching dead body for evidence.<br>
Izac expected this kind of Assassination will occur, eventually. Because him, and Evarist are taking a part of political conflict escalation.<br>
|<br>
Political conflict between General Schidor and Officer Kamdon had separated politician of Empire into two groups. One is called as [Hard-liners]. It formed by General Schidor and military clique who demanding war expansion. To against that party, Officer Kamdon formed party called [Control Faction] with powerful politicians. Opposite of [Hard-liners], they are seeking peaceful solutions in diplomacy.<br>
However, ostensibly, argument of different policy caused this political conflict; the main factor of this political conflict was greedy politician's selfish desire of obtaining political power<br>
|<br>
In that political conflict, Evarist served under General Schidor.<br>
General Schidor, an old general with insane passion, and Evarist, as assistant of general with the unimpassioned intellect, worked closely together in [Hard-liners].<br>
|<br>
Izac was the one who eliminated political opponents of [Head-Liners] in secret.<br>
First of all, he eliminated a couple of politicians in [Control Faction]. He used many ways to eliminate them without leaving any evidence.<br>
His action made [Control Faction] feared, and made them realize that the time of political strife had begun.<br>
After giving a first strike, Izac and Evarist kept severe attacking [Control Faction] before they take any actions.<br>
That was how Izac and Evarist would do to enemies outside, and it was all the same to enemies inside.<br>
|<br>
Izac enjoyed this [game]. He was enjoying its thrills.<br>
He loves to fight. To fight against enemies of other nation or to fight against enemies inside of the nation, it was all the same to him. As long as there is actual fight, he will enjoy.<br>
|<br>
Now [Head-liner] became the largest party.<br>
However, [Control Faction] decided not to be defeated forever...<br>
The time of vengeance had started.<br>
|<br>
Next day of avoiding assassination, Izac guarded Evarist to the camp in front line.<br>
After of that, he came back to Evarist's house to dispose a corpse remained in bathroom.<br>
He did not want leave any evidence of murder because the head of police organization was member of [Control Faction].<br>
|<br>
When he hung his coat, someone threw a stun grenade inside of the house.<br>
As soon as Izac saw it, he [switched] himself into battle mode.<br>
In that battle mode, everything became slow, and it gave enough time for Izac to cover his face to avoid the flash.<br>
Then, he pulled out his gun. He saw four heavy armed military police rushing into the house.<br>
Izac put his gun down and switched back to normal mode.<br>
|<br>
A man wearing uniform of Politburo, a group of raw bringer under the name of the emperor, showed up from the back of military police.<br>
“Captain Osvaldo. You are under arrest. Come with me.” Officer said with no expression.<br>
“Under arrest? I'm not doing anything bad. Grandma told me not to do such a thing!”<br>
Izac was still in calm. Officer asked,<br>
“What about the dead body and dynamites in bathroom?” Officer continued,<br>
“You need to come with me, captain. You are accused of murder. You will be examined by inquiry commission.”<br>
Izac understood in this point, assassination of last night was a part of scenario which [Control Faction] wrote.<br>
“If I said NO?” Izac asked.<br>
“This is decision of Politburo. If you resist our order, you will be considered as a traitor.”<br>
“A traitor, huh...Ha-ha. That's funny. OK! Let's be it!” Izac said with violent smile.<br>
“What the...!” Unexpected word from Izac confused officer.<br>
|<br>
Izac switched himself again. His sight blacked out for a moment. When he got his sight back, his sight was in the battle mode.<br>
He quickly moved towards to officer and grabbed his arm. Then he pulled off officer's arm with all of his strength.<br>
Human body ripped in alive flew in the air for a while and slammed into heavy armed police.<br>
The sight of police officer only showed ripped body of officer. It froze there sense. They could not believe what they just saw.<br>
|<br>
The strength and agility of Izac was overwhelming.<br>
Blood splashed by his dance of sword.<br>
Arms of police got cut off one after another.<br>
Like a child playing with insect, Izac continued to kill police officers with joy.<br>
Of course there was smile in his face.<br>
|<br>
After few minutes passed, Izac was the only one standing in pound of blood.<br>
Everyone else had been slayed in mercilessly.<br>
Izac went into bathroom, where the dead body of assassin is, to wash off blood stained in this boots. He sat on the tab started to clean up his boots neatly.<br>
Then he looked up in the air, after deep breath.<br>
|<br>
The night has come. Huge explosion occurred in imperial city.<br>
Evarist's house burned down. The night sky of imperial city dyed in deep red by the fire. Confusion due to this tragedy continued untill midnight.<br>
However, in news paper next day, this tragedy was not on the head line.<br>
The head line indicated that Officer Kamdon had been assassinated.<br>

5,66,1,"Year 3390. - Dear Mother -",1,"Jead was sitting down of the floor.<br>
He was gently looking into face of his mother lying down on the floor.<br>
Blood of his mother was soaked into wooden floor.<br>
|<br>
“Hurry up! You fool!!” Mother yelled from inside of the house.<br>
Jead shivered his body.<br>
It was a cold morning of winter; however, Jead was forced to draw water from water place in town.<br>
Cold air of winter morning iced Jead's swollen face, which had beaten by his mother last night. His mother beat him because he did not draw water from water place within the night.<br>
He walked towards water place with tottering step. He had not eaten any food over a week.<br>
There was no one around of water place.<br>
On the way back to the house, he sat down on the ground. He could not manage himself standing any longer because of lack of energy. His sight became hazy...Then he lost his consciousness.<br>
|<br>
Jead woke up by voice of old lady. His hazy sight showed ghost like old lady.<br>
Then old lady said,<br>
“This is karma.”<br>
Old lady pointed her finger to Jead's head. If he had enough energy, he would of slap away finger of old weird lady; however, he could not make any action under his current condition. He did not even able to think where he was and if this was in real or in the dream.<br>
He gave up thinking, he closed his eyes again.<br>
|<br>
When he woke up again, there is no one around him. He stud up slowly, and started to go home, dragging pail full of water. He used all of his remaining energy to hold his consciousness. After long time, he finally arrived to home.<br>
As soon as he enters the house, his mother took pail away.<br>
Then his mother kicked him hardly into the door.<br>
“Why it took so long! You useless fool! Don't have any foods for idiot like you!!!”<br>
“I'm sorry...mom”<br>
Jead apologized to his mother. He could not see her face.<br>
“Huh??You are sorry, huh?? Well then....”<br>
His mother opened the door, grabbed his arm, and threw him outside of the door.<br>
“Be sorry there, fool!” She slammed the door.<br>
It was very cold out. He got up slowly.<br>
He tried to open the door, once and twice...It did not open.<br>
He sat down on the ground after trying to open the door couple more times.<br>
His body started to shiver hardly. He held his knees to keep himself warm, and started daydreaming about the tender memories of his father.<br>
***<br>
Jead is walking around in a market holding hands of his parents. Colorful fruits with sweet smell caught Jead's attention. When his father saw that, he held up Jead in his arms, and convinced him to take one of them.<br>
Jead picked a small peach, and show it to father.<br>
Both mother and father were smiling.<br>
***<br>
Jead cannot visualize face of his own father anymore; however, the feel of father's hand still remains in his hand,<br>
|<br>
After a while of daydreaming, suddenly Jead felt warmness.<br>
Then he laid on the ground...<br>
Rain stated to fall after a while...<br>
Not many people were walking around in the slum...<br>
No one recognized remain of poor boy....<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
Jead woke up, on the bed. Room was in darkness of the night. Hanger caused him wide-awake. Then he realized a wired feeling. A feeling as he had been sleeping in cold outside. Also he felt strong tiredness.<br>
At the first, he thought his swollen face caused those weird feelings. However, that idea seemed to be wrong. He stopped thinking. He got out from his bed and started to look for a food. He thought he will be able to figure out about those wired feelings if he eats something.<br>
As he was searching for foods in the kitchen, he found an empty pail.<br>
“Need to go get water...”<br>
He grabbed empty pail and started to walk towards the door quietly not to wake his mother up.<br>
However, he felt down due to his tiredness and he made a big noise.<br>
Mother awoke by that noise, and she quickly got closer to Jead.<br>
“Why you are making such a noise! Trying to steal some food? You are disgusting thief!”<br>
Jead kicked hard by his mother.<br>
“You!! Useless fool!”<br>
Mother continued to kick him again, and again, and again.<br>
He was about to losing his consciousness.<br>
Mother stopped kicking and dragged him to the door and threw him outside the door.<br>
Jead was lying down on the street, again.<br>
There was no light around.<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
Jead woke up, on the bed. It was still dark outside.<br>
This time he remembered everything. He remembered being kicked a great amount of times by his mother. He remembered being threw to outside.<br>
He understood this is the same night as before.<br>
Somehow that night keeps coming back to Jead.<br>
He started to cry quietly. Now he surely knew he is going to be beaten by mother again.<br>
When he turned his sight to the other side of the room, he found pail.<br>
“Maybe it has water inside.”<br>
That was his last hope. With the body in pain, he started to crawl towards to that pail.<br>
He reached pail.<br>
It was empty inside.<br>
He lost all of his strength and crouched beside of pail.<br>
He looked in to pail again. It is still empty.<br>
While he was looking into pail, some feeling started welling up inside of him.<br>
That feeling was anger.<br>
Anger of pail being empty, anger of being forced to draw water, and anger of violence from his mother, every single matter had connected together.<br>
His heart started to beat violently. All of tiredness disappeared from his body.<br>
He started to think the way to express his anger.<br>
While he was thinking, he saw his mother sleeping on her bed. He thought she might be able to hear his wild heart beat, and if she awoke by Jead, will start beating him badly.<br>
That imagination made him move.<br>
He quickly grabbed a hard wine bottle on the table, and swung it down to head of his mother with all of his anger.<br>
Mother made strange sound, however she seemed still alive.<br>
Jead swung a bottle many times into her head again and again.<br>
After a hundreds of strikes, mother was completely dead.<br>
Now Jead knew the way to express his anger.<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
Jead woke up, on the bed.<br>
It was a quiet morning. Sunlight was coming in to the room.<br>
There was no pain and no tiredness in his body.<br>
A long continues night had finished.<br>
Jead got out from the bed, took bread from a shelf.<br>
He gathered necessary things up while he was eating bread.<br>
He put things into knapsack and got out from his house.<br>
It was warm morning for winter time.<br>
Jead looked back his house once, and then he walked away...<br>

6,56,1,"Year 3394. - Illusion -",1,"There was only sound of turning book page in a quiet library.<br>
“No...this is not it...this one...no...”<br>
Kronig whispered to himself. He put that book away, and took different book from pile of books beside of him. Sound of turning page broke the silence of the room again.<br>
|<br>
The library Kronig in now is placed in division of [Technocrat], high classed engineers.<br>
This library was known as knowledge source of the city [Pandemonium], contains variety kinds of books. Line-up of books starts from technical book of automata to ancient manuscripts written in the era of [Golden age].<br>
|<br>
Kronig put book aside again and took other book.<br>
“Book of psychiatry, huh?” Kronig muttered.<br>
He did not feel like to read this book. However, he pulled out from book shelf just for information. Kronig thought that it is just like comedy show, if person who researching dream of oneself reached to the conclusion that person is actually one of psychiatric patient.<br>
“Well, that will be much easy, if I was mentally harmed.”<br>
He bent his mouth ironically.<br>
He had been surrounded by illusion of weird creatures, natures, and the world, since of his childhood.<br>
|<br>
It started as a dream at the first.<br>
Every night when he closed his eyes on the bed, it showed up in his sight.<br>
|<br>
“In the sea of wired color, winding black and white things were approaching. It disappeared for a while and then appeared again. He looked at it carefully, and it started to turn into human body and started to float in shining sea.<br>
He turned his sight to horizon, a humongous creature with huge dorsal fin appeared.<br>
It was hiding its whole body under the sea...and stated to approaching...”<br>
|<br>
He always had a dream like that. He thought everyone has same dream as he does when he was a little child. However, as he grew up, he started to feel a gap in between his dream and dream of others. That gap kept growing in each day and finally, he noticed that his dream was totally different from normal dream which everyone would have.<br>
The twisted view of nature, creature out of ecosystem, the world with unnatural sound, smell, and taste, all of those wired vision kept showing up in his [dream]. All of existence in his [dream] had intense sense of reality.<br>
The worst point of his dream was a feeling of melting into the world of his [dream].<br>
|<br>
Kronig started fear the night. However, his [dream] did not just stay with the night.<br>
It came into his everyday life, also.<br>
He saw rainbow rode in this room, or sometime he saw purple grassland on the wall of building.<br>
He was once, able to eliminate those wired vision by ignoring them, however, as its frequency of appearance increases, he could not hold himself to ignore them completely. These wired vision remained in his real life unless he really concentrates on himself.<br>
|<br>
One day, Kronig found pass key of [Technocrat] in his father's home office. Might be able to have access to library which approved only for [Technocrat], he thought.<br>
He knew that library contain documents from ancient era [Golden age], or [age of Twilight], when dramatic expansion of knowledge took place in Pandemonium city.<br>
“I can do some research in that library.”<br>
With hope, he decided to sneak in to library of [Technocrat].<br>
|<br>
Fortunately, that library located in the area with low security. Because of the most of Technocrats had enough knowledge of themselves to be as Technocrat, this library was not used by them often. That is the reason why Kronig could sneak in easily. He started his research about his wired [dream], which is now had become as [illusion].<br>
|<br>
After spending a couple hours of research, Kronig felt wired feeling almost same as the feeling of his [illusions]. He put his head up from document he was reading.<br>
There are no illusions around of him; however, he still could feel presence of it.<br>
He felt something is calling him so he started to look around.<br>
Then he found an old metallic shelf with sliding door on it. It showed different atmosphere from all of another shelves in this library.<br>
He put down the book and walked towards that weird shelf.<br>
He tried to open the door on that shelf, however it had been locked.<br>
“What's in here?” Kronig whispered.<br>
Even though he used all of his strength to open, he was unable to break that old simple lock.<br>
--I need to see inside!!!<br>
At the moment Kronig desired, the presence of his illusion floated from his body all at once. Pain, disgust, ecstasy, etc..... All of sense became as one, and it started to drive through his body.<br>
“....! What the.....!”<br>
The world started to shake. Fear of being in his [dream] came out.<br>
He started to concentrate to hold himself from mind destruction.<br>
“I'm here...I exist here!!!”<br>
He leaned against the shelf and continued muttering.<br>
|<br>
Torrent of sensation vanished suddenly as it started.<br>
“What was that??”<br>
When he put his hand on the shelf to stand up, the door on shelf started to slide open soundlessly. It had been dead locked just a while ago...he thought, however, the document inside of shelf dragged his attention more than his question.<br>
It seemed an old report of research work.<br>
He took it out and opened.<br>
As soon he started to read that report, his sight caught a thing, thing that never been existed in the world.<br>
|<br>
That was Kronig's first contact with [Phantom Beast].<br>

7,46,1,"Year 3394. - Prisoner -",1,"Leon was dreaming. He was dreaming about his childhood.<br>
He was on back side of carriage looking into evil whirlpool [Profound]. It was shining under the moonlight mysteriously. The view like this, would never been seen by people who lives behind safe wall. He felt like he owned this view, and that thought made him some how proud of himself. He wished to look this view forever.<br>
|<br>
Someone poured water in Leon's head.<br>
As soon as he woke up, pain of his whole body came back as heat.<br>
“Come on, that was a nice dream, you bastard.” Leon, in chain, muttered to tormentor.<br>
“Speak, or die.” Tormentor ignored his complain, and threat him.<br>
Leon failed to count days of he had been chained. He counted up to three days, and that was the limit. His arm, in chain, swollen red, and pain in his back was burning as hell fire.<br>
“Come on tough men, take this.” Tormentor whipped Leon's back once, and twice quickly. Leon was about to pass out. He heard the voice of tormentor saying,<br>
“Where is your fellow?” in faraway.<br>
While he was losing his consciousness, he again recalled memory of his fried Archibald's action.<br>
|<br>
Leon grew up in group of trader in wasteland called [Storm Rider].<br>
They used be trading agent in dangerous wasteland. However, once wasteland became safe after vanishing of evil whirlpool [Profound], those trading agents like Storm Rider became unnecessary. They ultimately disappeared from wasteland.<br>
Leon felt that he lost his meaning of life, just as sailor with the world of no sea.<br>
It was not easy life as [Storm Rider]; however, Leon was comfortable to be one of them. After losing his [family], he was always being frustrated.<br>
|<br>
During that time period, someone knocked the door of Leon's house.<br>
“Wuz up. Long time no see, dude.” A visitor said as soon as Leon opened his door.<br>
“Archibald? Thought you're dead somewhere in wasteland! I guess those monsters didn't like the smell of your breath, huh?”<br>
Visitor was Leon's old friend Archibald, who fought in [Regiment] together, also the one who gave fighting lesson to Leon.<br>
“Bad mouth as usually, huh? How you doing?” Archibald said.<br>
“I'm doing fine. Just a bit frustrated. But it's much better here than living in capital.”<br>
Leon could not hide his gladness to meet with his old friend.<br>
Archibald took his hat off and sat on the chair.<br>
Both of them enjoyed easygoing conversation for a while. They talked about their old friends or, old memories of [Regiment]. It was a peaceful time for both of them.<br>
|<br>
Archibald brought out his main issue after conversation.<br>
“I'm here to offer you a job. I'm going to attack some caravan. Can't do it by myself. Need your help, dude.” Archibald said seriously.<br>
“Tough one?” Leon asked.<br>
“Yup. But it won't be that tough, if we're both on it.”<br>
“Give me the detail.”<br>
|<br>
Detail of job Archibald offered was attacking caravan sent from Imperroda to Meriguadia. Caravan will formed by 40 to 50 traders with Imperrodian force. To keep secrecy of caravan, those Imperrodian force, as caravan guards, will be camouflaged as trader. The route of caravan was kept in secret, also.<br>
Archibald said that he already confirmed caravan route, and also he said it need to be done as soon as possible.<br>
|<br>
“Ok. I'm on.” Said Leon, and continued,<br>
“But I want know the reason why we're doing this? For money, or for your political belief, I don't give a crap. I just want to know the purpose, that's it.”<br>
“Purpose, huh?” Archibald took a breath.<br>
“For the world, I'd say.”<br>
“No juggling here” Leon said in serious tone.<br>
Archibald put his hat on and stood up. Then said,<br>
“I'm serious, dude”<br>
“Oh OK, I see you don't wanna talk about it, huh? That's fine.”<br>
Leon showed sulky face. However, he was willing to take this job, because fighting together with Archibald was priceless reward for him.<br>
“I'll be here tomorrow. Don't have much time left.”<br>
Archibald left the house.<br>
|<br>
Preparation of this [business] went smooth. They found suitable location for attacking caravan, and set bombs on to that location. Also they prepared a carriage full of bombs.<br>
After that only thing they had to do was just to wait for the target. They build a small camp a little away from attacking point and started wait.<br>
|<br>
In the night before attacking, Leon asked Archibald,<br>
“What are you going to do after this business?”<br>
“Well, there are lots of things waiting to be done. You can help me if you want.”<br>
“...I'll think about it” Leon made his response.<br>
|<br>
Next day, the target appeared around the noon. There were three carriages. When horse of the front carriage approached to trap, Archibald pushed the switch. Huge explosion occurred. First carriage blew away completely.<br>
Other carriages stopped moving. Guards launched out. As soon as Leon saw it, he started to speed up the carriage, with a lot of bombs. He made his way straight up towards to second carriage. Guards fired their guns to Leon's carriage; however, Leon handled carriage cleverly to avoid gun fires.<br>
In a meanwhile, Archibald fired his guns in both hand. One, two, three...caravan guards fell down one after another.<br>
Leon jumped off from his carriage just a moment before it crashed into caravan carriage.<br>
Explosion occurred right after collision of two carriages.<br>
Leon got up quickly and turned around to the last caravan carriage. He saw Archibald eliminating most of caravan guards. Leon pulled out his knife and started to attack remain caravan guards.<br>
|<br>
About after ten minutes from last explosion, sound of gun fire had stopped. Only crackling sound of burning caravan remained around the area.<br>
Archibald called Leon from in the shade of last carriage.<br>
“Hey, Leon. Need your hands. Come here.”<br>
“OK, I'll be there soon.”<br>
As soon as Leon made his way to caravan, he suddenly stunned by something.<br>
“I'm sorry my friend.”<br>
Leon heard his friend's voice from his back. He tried to turn around to see Archibald's face; however, he was unable to move his body. Leon lost his consciousness after heavy impact.<br>
Next time he woke up, he was in the jail.<br>
Archibald had disappeared with materials which caravans were carrying.<br>
Only Leon was arrested by Imperrodian force.<br>
|<br>
Leon awoke by water again.<br>
“Your friend abandoned you, right? You don't have a reason to cover your friend, any more, right?” Tormentor said with tender tone. Seems that tormentor had changed his way to force a confession from Leon.<br>
“Eat crap and die, you stinky pig.” Leon insulted tormentor.<br>
Right after hearing Leon's word, tormentor stepped out from jail for a moment, and then he came back with burning iron pole.<br>
“That's it. I'll shut your mouth, you stinky prisoner!”<br>
Tormentor pointed Leon's face by burning iron pole as threat.<br>
“I had enough of your crap. Do it!”<br>
Face of tormentor turned into red by anger.<br>
Someone came into jail right after Leon said it.<br>

8,76,1,"Year 3382. - Friendship -",1,"A bullet ripped rope hanging Will Palantine.<br>
Sound of gun fire made crowds run away. Archibald on auto-horse continued firing his gun to eliminate executors. He held Palantine up to his auto-horse and said,<br>
“Massed up, huh? Are you still alive?”<br>
“Archibald? Is that you?...Why you came here?”<br>
Long period of time being under arrested had weakened Palantine; however, he was able to hang on to back of Archibald tightly.<br>
“Let's talk about it later. We've got to go.”<br>
Archibald ran his auto-horse in confused crowd. He handled his horse skillfully to avoid crowds and obstacles. City guard recovered from confusion, and started to chase after Archibald.<br>
Archibald knew that these city guards would not be able to chase them in wasteland, so he decided to quickly get outside of the city wall. He speeded up his horse even faster.<br>
There were a couple of gate keepers waiting to arrest Archibald and Palantine in front of city gate. Archibald shot them down quickly, then, him and his auto-horse launched out from the gate. Auto-hose, with Archibald and Palantine on it, ran on wasteland. Dispersive sound of gun fire continued, however, it finished after a while. There was no one chasing after them on the wasteland.<br>
|<br>
Shadow of the night started to reach wasteland. As looking the sunset in west, Archibald ran his auto-horse to the main camp of resistance which formed by Palantine.<br>
Even though Palantine was not the member of [Storm Riders] living in wasteland, he put [Storm Riders] in main position of his revolutionary army. Palantine moved city, to city, under cover of [Storm Riders], for his army preparation. He became under arrest by kingdom force during that time. Fortunately, he was not recognized as the leader of resistance; however, he almost had been executed as member of resistance.<br>
|<br>
Archibald noticed there is something wrong with Palantine. He slowed down his horse and held him down from horse. Palantine was groaning in pain.<br>
Archibald decided to have camp in wasteland. He knew it is unsecure, however, he did not want to continue running with Palantine in such a condition.<br>
“Will! Can you hear me?” asked Archibald.<br>
Palantine opened his eyes; however, his sight was in faint.<br>
“Archibald? ...Where is this?”<br>
“It's outside of the city. No one is chasing after us.”<br>
“Why you came?” Asked Palatine.<br>
“Because I wanted” Archibald responded quickly.<br>
“You're sent by Sheila aren't you?” Palantine made his guess.<br>
“Well...Yeah.” Archibald took water bottle and let Palantine drink some.<br>
“Are you wounded?” Archibald asked to Palantine.<br>
“No, I'm OK. Just tired...will be fine after a while.”<br>
Now Archibald noticed the shadow of illness on Palantine's face.<br>
“Tell me the truth, Will. Can't stay with you for long time.”<br>
Palatine smiled. After taking deep breath, Palantine spoke the truth.<br>
“...It's my lungs. Seems the air in wasteland didn't suit me well. ....I'm on [Gould].”<br>
Palantine put his hand on his chest. [Gould], as know as deadly sickness in wasteland, caused by polluted air from evil whirlpool [Profound]. It first damages one's lung, and then will start to destroy whole body.<br>
Archibald was shocked for a moment, then told Palantine,<br>
“...Well. Let's take a rest here. Sleep.”<br>
“Thank you...”<br>
Palantine closed his eyes.<br>
Archibald stood up and took his baggage off from his auto-horse.<br>
The light from evil whirlpool [Profound] was shinning in the horizon.<br>
|<br>
Both Palantine and Archibald had been close friend over 10 years.<br>
Archibald was born in wasteland. He took off from his birthplace when he was young.<br>
He wondered around the wasteland. At some point, he hired as city guard of Imperrodian city [Hyden]. That is where Archibald met Palatine. Palatine was also member of city guard.<br>
At that time, corruption of Imperrodian government was causing a lot of riots in each city of Imperroda. As city guard, the main task was to point gun at citizens. Both Palantine and Archibald hated that task, so they decided to join riot with a couple of other city guard.<br>
A result of that emotional action of two young men came out as bitter experience.<br>
Many of citizens had killed and two young men had defeated by Imperrodian army badly.<br>
After being defeated, they made their way to the wasteland.<br>
A of group of Storm Rider, which Archibald born under, rescued those two.<br>
In that camp of [Storm Rider], Palantine started his life as leader of resistance.<br>
He traveled around cities in Imperroda kingdom to gather up rebellious elements and turned them into revolutionary forces.<br>
It started as a small group first, however, as time goes, it continued to grow bigger and stronger.<br>
However, Archibald was not standing beside of the leader, Palatine.<br>
|<br>
Archibald was thinking about his past in front of fire.<br>
“...Revolution will be accomplished without me...You didn't have to put your life in danger to rescue me, Archibald.”<br>
Archibald heard the voice of his friend.<br>
“Come on. That's not like you. “Indomitable Fighter“, Palantine.”<br>
Archibald used old nickname of Palantine to encourage him.<br>
“...My wish will come true...It's almost there. I'd have no regret even if I die now.“ Palatine muttered.<br>
“What about Sheila? You are not alone, you know that, right?”<br>
Archibald brought up the name, with bitter memory of himself.<br>
“She knows I can't live longer. Also, I was preparing for it.”<br>
Palatine continued,<br>
“I did my best...for everything. There is nothing I can do more.”<br>
Face of Palantine is covered with peaceful smile.<br>
“I don't think so. I really do not think so. You still have much more to do!”<br>
Archibald said angry but sadly. He still could not to face the fact that his best friend had affected by deadly disease.<br>
“Much more, huh?”<br>
Palantine turned his sight up in the sky, and he fell into sleep again.<br>
|<br>
After the sunrise, condition of Palantine seemed to settle down.<br>
They departed from camp.<br>
When the sun reached top of the sky, main camp of resistance started to appear. However, as they get closer to, they recognized some abnormal situation in the main camp. Archibald speeded up his auto-horse.<br>
|<br>
The main camp was annihilated.<br>

9,106,1,"Year 3390. - About a Girl -",1,"That was an easy mission. Sheri thought that on the carriage.<br>
Sneak in to target's house as one of the servants. Her client, one of the most trusted servants of target, helped her to sneak in easy. Then she put poison into target's dinner. That was it.<br>
She did not care how target will suffer. She did not care what he thinks at the end of his life. She just cares about assassinate her target as she told to.<br>
Some target begged crying for her mercy, some target took a sword to fight against her, and some target offered great amount of money. All of them failed to survive. Sheri, the merciless assassin just followed order from her master.<br>
|<br>
In the [Dawn Light age], when Granddillenia, Lubiana, Meriguadia, Myocca, and Imperroda, each nation had raised their army to struggle for supremacy of the world, assassins were needed everywhere. If there is a reward, master of assassin would send his assassins to anytime, anywhere, to assassinate anybody. Sheri was one of the members of master's assassins.<br>
|<br>
Master of assassin, as old gentlemen, gave new mission to Sheri.<br>
“This is the target of this mission. I am willing to hear the [good news] from you, Sheri.”<br>
Master handed Sheri document of target. There was a picture of little girl. Sheri looked back her master.<br>
“You seem to be a little perplexed...You may refuse to take this mission, if you wish.”<br>
Master spoke to Sheri in soft voice.<br>
“No, master, I will take this mission.” Sheri responded.<br>
“Good girl, Sheri... Well, then...Have a nice day.” Master said in soft voice, again.<br>
|<br>
In the night of that day, Sheri sneaked into target's house without any problems.<br>
She found target of little girl, holding her little black dog, in her bed room.<br>
“You came to kill me, right?” It seemed that she is already aware of her destiny.<br>
“You can kill me, but please, please don't kill this little baby. Please...”<br>
Little girl begged for her little dog.<br>
The dog started to bark.<br>
Sheri pulled her knife out without any words, then she stood ready to slay both little girl and black dog. However, she could not move her body. Some unknown feeling had stopped her.<br>
As she stood there being hesitated, the door of the room opened.<br>
“Don't move!” Guard came in to the room and pointed their guns to Sheri, and said,<br>
“Please come here” to little girl. Then little girl ran, and hid behind of guards.<br>
Mission failed. Sheri thought, however, she gave a sigh of relief inside of her.<br>
Sound of gun fire occurred in the room while Sheri was making plan to escape.<br>
Little was lying down on the floor.<br>
“Oh, poor little girl. She got a shot by a stray bullet! Oh no!”<br>
One of the guards shouted derisively. Then turned around to Sheri and continued,<br>
“Heard my client hired a good one...But you couldn't even kill such a little girl...Useless.”<br>
Now she understood the situation. Her client had hired another assassins as insurance, or maybe to assassinate Sheri to keep a secret.<br>
“Now, this is the time for you to die!”<br>
Sheri started to run towards the window as soon as guards started to fire their gun.<br>
She got a couple of shoots in her arm, however, finally managed to reach the window and jumped off into the shadow of the night.<br>
None of the guards were chasing after her.<br>
As running away from the house, she heard a sad howling of black dog.<br>
It continued for a long time.<br>
|<br>
Next day, Sheri reported to her master about the thing happened last night.<br>
“I see...Well as long as you are still alive, that is good.”<br>
He spoke to Sheri with tender smile.<br>
“Everyone makes mistake, so do not be disappointed. Please take a good care of your wounds.”<br>
Sheri nodded once before she leaves master's room.<br>
|<br>
There was a black dog lying down in front of Sheri's house.<br>
It looked dead, however, when it saw Sheri in sight, stood up weakly and started to walk towards Sheri with growl.<br>
The dog attempted to attack Sheri; however, fell down on the ground again in front of her. Sheri pulled out her knife and attempted to throw it to the dog. However, memory of the black dog of last night flashed back in her head. She stopped killing this dog.<br>
Even though, Sheri knew this dog is not the same one as that little girl's black dog, she could not do anything to this dog.<br>
The dog was in same position in the next day. Dog did not growl or when he saw Sheri this time. She failed to move that dog away. Then she had a sudden whim to feed this dog. Dog started devouring when she gave some food.<br>
|<br>
Sheri assassinated many kinds of target, a politician, a noble, a military officer, and a millionaire, as she ordered. Each time after her mission, there was a black dog waiting her in front of her house.<br>
|<br>
One day, when Sheri came home, the dog was dead.<br>
She did not mean to own it, and of cause, she did not have any fondness.<br>
It is just a dog died in front of her house. That is all about it, Sheri thought.<br>
However, tears started to float over from her eyes.<br>
Master came beside Sheri, and asked,<br>
“Is that your dog, Sheri?”<br>
“No, sir.”<br>
She answered. She did not own that dog. She just stayed together.<br>
“Are you in sad?” Master asked again. Sheri could not answer to this question.<br>
“May I have that dog, Sheri?”<br>
Sheri nodded. She could not refuse her master, and there was no reason to be attached to dead dog.<br>
Master said,<br>
“To be needed by someone...That is a delight thing, don't you think so?”<br>
Master left from Sheri holding dead dog in his arm.<br>
|<br>
“Are you alright?”<br>
“I know you can to much better, Sheri.”<br>
“I believe you will not fail next mission.”<br>
Tender voice of master hurt Sheri deep inside.<br>
Since, after death of that dog, Sheri started to fail her mission frequently. Because she knew how it is like to be in sadness, she could not swing her knife as used be able to.<br>
Sheri, the [merciless assassin] had disappeared to somewhere. She lost her self-esteem as assassin.<br>
One day, she suddenly realized that assassination was the only thing she had done in her entire life. She did not know another way of living, and she knew she cannot live in another way.<br>
She was in deep despair after realizing of herself.<br>
She pulled her knife, which used to assassinate a target, and cut her own wrist.<br>
Blood kept coming out, and she started to lose her consciousness slowly.<br>

10,96,1,"Year 3392. - Blue Sky -",1,"“May I have your explanation please?”<br>
An inspector of [Audit Office of Pandemonium] asked to Blaise politely. He had frozen smile in his face.<br>
[Audit Office of Pandemonium] inspects and eliminates criminals and infected person in Pandemonium.<br>
Blaise was one of the agents named as [Inquisitor].<br>
|<br>
“No-22458 and No-18673, both of them found dead, sir”<br>
Blaise answered.<br>
“On your report, it says you did not have visual observation. How did you confirm those are dead for sure?”<br>
Officer still had smile on his face. Even though, he is the boss, attitude of him made Blaise irritated.<br>
“Those two are dead for sure, sir. I checked their record of burial.” Blaise answered.<br>
“Why you did not dig up their grave to check?” His boss asked again.<br>
“There was no need to do it, sir”<br>
“Who made that decision?”<br>
“It's me, sir.”<br>
“Well...I see.”<br>
|<br>
Boss started to type his keyboard.<br>
When he finished up-dating record, he put his head up and said,<br>
“This case is closed, with an annotation.” He never put his smile away.<br>
“You are doing great, Inquisitor Blaise. I hope you will keep up with it.”<br>
Blaise thought he will not like this man's attitude forever.<br>
“If you working hard like this, your little sister will get better soon.”<br>
His boss even threats Blaise with smile on his face. It took a while for Blaise to calm down himself. He took off from the room in silence. Blaise knew it is not a good idea to express his emotion in front of his boss.<br>
|<br>
He headed down to hospital after leaving building of [Audit Office of Pandemonium].<br>
On the auto coach, he was looking up in the sky. Even though, Pandemonium was not really exciting city, he liked its view of the sky. Contrast of high building, with wired ornament, and blue sky had created beautiful harmony of the view.<br>
Hospital, which his sister being hospitalized, had located in the middle of the city.<br>
In a hospital room, his sister was lying down on the bed. She had been in a state of apparent death for 3 years. Her body was covered by special sheets to protect her from bacteria, because her immune strength had been decreased.<br>
|<br>
Outside of the window, there was beautiful blue sky.<br>
Blaise held his sister's hand tenderly. When he felt her warmness, he felt delight.<br>
He again, determined himself to do whatever he can do to save his little sister.<br>
She was the only hope for him in this world.<br>
|<br>
He leaved hospital. He called his coach, and there was someone with mask already inside of it.<br>
|<br>
Moon light shaped dreary shadow in the castle.<br>
Wind of the night was getting colder and colder.<br>
Two men in overcoat were walking up the hill to the castle.<br>
Only their shadows shaped by moon light were behind of them.<br>
Two men, Blaise and masked man, walked into the castle.<br>
In the castle, making their passage from shadow to shadow, they reached to a hall.<br>
Under the moon light from high top window, there was a man standing.<br>
It was a men called as [Black Prince], Grunwald, the prince of Lonsbrough Kingdom.<br>
The prince pulled out his sword. So as Blaise did.<br>
A masked man stepped back into the shadow and disappeared silently.<br>
|<br>
Blade of prince shinned. Then it slayed head of Blaise, however, body of Blaise had vanished with its afterimage. Right after of that, Blaise showed up backside of the [Black Prince], then he attempted to stub prince's body.<br>
Prince guarded that attack buy his sword, then he stepped away from Blaise.<br>
They faced each other in a distance.<br>
Suddenly, sword of Blaise flashed. That light became in shape of a big sphere, and then it covered whole body of prince.<br>
When the light disappeared, sword of prince was fallen on the floor.<br>
|<br>
“Not enough practice, Grunwald.” Blaise said.<br>
“Just kill me, Blaise. Kill me as you did to our friends.”<br>
Blaise took a long breath and opened his mouth.<br>
“I guess you want to call me as traitor, huh? Well, I don't care if you do. I have my justice.”<br>
“How many you've killed?” Grunwald asked<br>
“Didn't need to kill them...Most of them ruin themselves...Sucked into their own force...<br>
Infected person can't live long, you know that, right?”<br>
Blaise did not lie. Many of infected person, which Blaise had found, were dead by alcohols and drags, or sometime suicide.<br>
“There were few of them try to fight just like you did.”<br>
Blade put his sword to neck of Grunwald.<br>
“It seems hard for fighters to live, if they lose place to die.” Blaise said.<br>
“You are the one also, Blaise.” Grunwald showed his anger.<br>
“I still have reason to live.” Blaise grabbed Grunwald's hand to make him stand up.<br>
“Stand up Grunwald...I'm not here to kill you, tonight.”<br>
Both of them put their sword away.<br>
|<br>
“I like my life in Pandemonium. It's wired city, but good enough.”<br>
Blaise was talking at the back of Grunwald, who sat on stair way.<br>
Blaise continued to talk.<br>
“Everything was so simple at that time. We fight as Regiment knight, and we die as Regiment knight.”<br>
Blaise was actually thinking that in the past.<br>
“However, the world changed. Nothing will be the same again.”<br>
Grunwald kept in silence. Blaise continued.<br>
“If you want to have something in your hand, you've got to make a decision.”<br>
Grunwald tuned his head and looked up Blaise.<br>
“I've already made up my mind. How about you?”<br>
There was no answer to that question.<br>
|<br>
A masked man showed up again after a while.<br>
“Well, it's the time to go.”<br>
Blaise put his hand on to Grunwald's shoulder and spoke to him.<br>
“I know what your sword desires. Be a man. No one can take over your pain.”<br>
|<br>
On the way back from the castle, Blaise saw sliver pipe in masked man's hand.<br>
“You've done your task well, Max.”<br>
He continued to speak,<br>
“If you want to write a report of tonight, just go ahead.” Write down Blaise did not kill prince.”<br>
Blaise did not wait for answer from Max because this masked man almost never talks.<br>
“It will be settled, eventually”<br>
Blaise muttered under the moon light.<br>

11,116,1,"- Mother Tree -",1,"Ayn was climbing up to one of her favorite tree in forest.<br>
She loved the feeling of this tree and also the smell of this forest.<br>
She reached to her favorite branch, started to look in to a view of entire forest.<br>
The Sunlight through leaves shines tenderly.<br>
Cloud in the blue sky floats as usually, and the air was clean as always.<br>
She even felt as the time had stopped in this forest.<br>
Before she begins her journey, she wanted to memorize this beautiful view.<br>
|<br>
“There you are! Ayn!”<br>
Someone called Ayn from lower position of tree.<br>
It was little girl, Sprout.<br>
When Sprout climbed up to branch Ayn was sitting, she jumped on to Ayn.<br>
Then Sprout asked to Ayn sadly,<br>
“You really have to go?”<br>
“Yup.” Ayn answered.<br>
“No...NO! Please don't leave me alone.”<br>
Voice of Sprout was all most crying.<br>
“I'm sorry Sprout, but someone has to go.”<br>
“Is that has to be you?”<br>
|<br>
There were no experienced warriors left in this forest. Most of them had lost their life or wounded in battle of [Black Night]. Only inexperienced young warriors remained after all. Ayn was one of them. Even though, she was not the greatest one, [Mother of Forest], elder of the forest people, had chosen Ayn as seeker of the [orb].<br>
|<br>
“Yes. I am going. I need to go.” Ayn said to Sprout.<br>
She could have refused that task; however, she decided to take that honorable but dangerous task, right away. She was proud of herself when she knew she had been chosen as the seeker. Some of jealous young warrior threw mean words to her. She did not care them at all. Some of her friend made advice to stay in forest; however, she did not take that advice. She thought that taking this task was her fate.<br>
|<br>
Ayn stroked Sprouts hair soothingly.<br>
“Do you still have a nightmare?” Ayn tried to switch subject by throwing question to her. Sprout started to have nightmare of evil maggot after [Black Night]. She had sharp intuition.<br>
“I'm fine. I'm not scared of it anymore. I'm scared more you leaving be alone!”<br>
Sprout brought subject back.<br>
“It will be fine, Sprout.” Ayn continued stroking Sprout's hair tenderly.<br>
|<br>
“Do you know where [Dark Sailors] are?” Sprout asked.<br>
“Elders have found them, I heard.” Ayn answered.<br>
Attackers of [Black Night] had named by people of the forest as [Dark Sailors].<br>
They started to invade the forest suddenly. They seized forest in one night and took the [orb] away.<br>
|<br>
“Elder said they are in different world.” Ayn said.<br>
“There are lots of them, right? I'm scared.”<br>
“It will be fine. [Mother of Forest] is on my side. Don't worry.”<br>
Sprout did not say anything. She started to hold Ayn tight.<br>
“Sprout...Please take care of mom and dad.”<br>
“...I will” Sprout nodded slightly.<br>
They stayed there for a while. Then Sprout fell into a sleep.<br>
|<br>
Ayn knew that she may not be able to come back.<br>
However, before evil maggot finds this forest, she needs to come back with the orb.<br>
She will has to take whatever it takes to defend this beautiful forest, and life of this little Sprout. She thought that strongly.<br>
|<br>
Sprout moaned. She might of having nightmare of evil maggot.<br>
It scares Ayn to even imagine about it.<br>
Ayn had seen it once.<br>
It appeared in a cloud of dust outside of forest almost close to horizon.<br>
Huge white body was slowly swallowing everything down.<br>
Elders of forest were saying no one will be able to kill it. In the old story, ancient magician made himself into a huge maggot for his vengeance. After long time, he lost his memory and became a real monster. It would swallow everything but the place with the [orb].<br>
No one knows if that story is true or not.<br>
However, maggot exists for real. Ayn need to find and get back the orb.<br>
|<br>
“Wake up, Sprout.” Ayn awoke Sprout.<br>
“Are you OK?” She asked.<br>
“Yup. I'm fine.” Sprout tried to hide her fear but failed to hide all of it.<br>
“I need to go now.” Ayn said.<br>
“Can I go with you, Ayn?”<br>
“No, no one is allowed to.” Ayn denied a little bit strong this time.<br>
Sprout was shocked for a moment, then said<br>
“So...Good-bye now?”<br>
“Yes...I'm sorry, Sprout”<br>
“Don't be sorry, Ayn. I will never forget about you! Come back here!”<br>
Sprout started to cry. Ayn held Sprout tightly then said<br>
“See you again. We'll meet here.”<br>
“Yes! I'll be waiting for you!”<br>
Warmness through Sprout's body encouraged Ayn.<br>
She left Sprout slowly and started to climb down the tree.<br>
Every time Ayn looked back Sprout, she was waving her hand.<br>
|<br>
The night has reached to the forest. Star was shining.<br>
Around [Mother Tree] in the middle of forest, 12 elders ware there.<br>
Each of them had a cane made by brunch of [Mother Tree].<br>
They are reciting magic word which Ayn had never heard of.<br>
Even though Ayn could not understand those magic words, she was feeling magical force.<br>
[Mother of Forest] stood in front of [Mother Tree]. When she raised her hand, [Mother Tree] started to shine tenderly.<br>
Large crack opened around the root of [Mother Tree].<br>
Ayn put into crack by elders.<br>
|<br>
[Mother Tree] exist every where even in different world. Ayn will be sent to other world by using that power.<br>
Ayn took off her cloth and walked towards into the light.<br>
When [Mother Tree] took her inside, it slowly closed its crack.<br>
Ayn closed her eyes. Smile of Sprout and beautiful view of the forest appeared in the darkness. Also the face of [Dark Sailor] showed up. She memorized that face just before he loose her consciousness.<br>

It was a beginning of her honorable journey.<br>

12,7,1,"Year 3397. - Dinner Party -",1,"Most of the ruling classes, such as nobles or politicians, were invited to this kind dinner party at palace once in a while.<br>
Tonight, the party was organized by [Head Liners], so there was none of nobles or politicians in [Control Faction] had invited to this party.<br>
Instead of them, there were some military officers were invited. Evarist, with Izac, was invited also.<br>
|<br>
“What a rich dinner, huh? We're in a war, aren't we?”<br>
Izac was complaining while he was devouring foods.<br>
“You can think whatever you want. Just don't speak out, Lieutenant Osvaldo.”<br>
Someone warned Izac from his back.<br>
“Well I speak what I want to speak, sir...”<br>
Izac responded to warning with rude attitude. He thought that someone who warned him was either Evarist or some politicians who he does not even know the face.<br>
He found General Schidor standing, with wine glass in his hand, when he turned around.<br>
“Oops... Please excuse me, sir.” General Schidor seemed that he did not care about Izac's rude attitude.<br>
“Well, this is a fun party. Why don't you enjoy yourself more, Lieutenant Osvaldo?”<br>
General Schidor said to Izac.<br>
“I am enjoying this wonderful dinner, sir. However, I would be having more fun in battle field.”<br>
Izac was smiling when he said that.<br>
“Ha-ha. That's nice...By the way; do you know where Major Waltz is?”<br>
To answer General's question, Izac pointed his fork with a wry smile, to direction where Evarist should be.<br>
General turned his head to that direction, and then he found Evarist dancing with some young lady.<br>
“Ah, I see. Nice step huh?”<br>
General laughed.<br>
|<br>
Unlike other military officers, Evarist leaded his partner with his elegant steps.<br>
Around of Evarist, there was group of young ladies waiting their turn to dance with him.<br>
These ladies seemed that all of them were daughter of powerful politicians.<br>
Perhaps these young ladies wanted to introduce themselves to handsome young hero with a promising future.<br>
“Mr. Waltz! May I dance with you?” “No! It's my turn next!” “No way!”<br>
Ladies started to surround Evarist when he finished dancing, and they had blocked General's way.<br>
General clapped his hand to drag their attention, and started to talk.<br>
“I am sorry ladies. Please excuse me to borrow Major Waltz for a while.”<br>
“You are not excused, sir!!!”<br>
Unified voice denied General.<br>
“Please excuse me ladies, I'll be back soon.”<br>
Evarist smiled gently to ladies to help General Schidor.<br>
|<br>
“Well, it seems my status of General does not mean anything to those young ladies, huh?”<br>
General said to Evarist after walking away from young ladies.<br>
“These young ladies just likes popular person, sir.” Evarist responded.<br>
General laughed once and said to Evarist in serious tone.<br>
“Follow me Major. Some [lady] wants to see you.”<br>
Both of them got out from party room and started to walk in hallway.<br>
|<br>
There was young beautiful lady sitting on magnificent chair. Her noble figure was totally different from young ladies in party room.<br>
Empress Alicetaria, speaker of [Immortal Emperor], and also the icon of Empire, was sitting in front of Evarist.<br>
If there was dominate power in this Empire, it will be under her name.<br>
Evarist knelt down and saluted to empress.<br>
|<br>
Empress Alicetaria stood up from chair and walked to in front of Evarist.<br>
Evarist kissed her hand and stood up, and then said,<br>
“It is my honor to see Your Majesty.”<br>
“I heard your great efforts in front line. I am proud of you.” Empress gave her word to Evarist.<br>
“I thank Your Majesty. All of my men worked hard for my efforts. I am proud of them.”<br>
Empress Alicetaria looked much younger than her portrait. Her eyes had mysterious lights of both tenderness and coldness.<br>
There were only two of them after general Schidor stepped out of the room quietly./<br>
“You look strained, Evarist. Just two of us are here. I allow you to speak normally.”<br>
Empress smiled to Evarist.<br>
“I thank you for your kindness...I never imagined meet you in this room.”<br>
As the empress said, Evarist did not feel any signs of empress guards.<br>
The empress laughed gracefully and responded to Evarist.<br>
“I'll be wherever I want to be in this palace, so be aware of that.”<br>
While she was saying that, she slowly came close to Evarist and she held his arm, and said,<br>
“I said, don't be nervous. No one is around here.”<br>
|<br>
After introducing Evarist to the empress, General Schidor went back to party hall.<br>
Many people showed their respect and flattered to him as soon as they saw him while he was walking around in party hall.<br>
He was in a good mood to confirm his own power.<br>
|<br>
In such a situation, General Beard came to speak with General Schidor.<br>
Unlike other participants, General Beard was not belonged to [Head-Liner].<br>
“Listen, Schidor...one of your man, Major Waltz, he his dangerous. He is a kind of man hides ambition. His eyes are showing it.<br>
General Schidor responded.<br>
“That is why I use him, Beard. He is the icon of young soldiers. It raises the morale of soldiers if I treat him well. And of course, he can't to do anything without my back-up.”<br>
General Beard shook his head, and said,<br>
“Well, it used to be like that. But the thing always changes.”<br>
General Schidor laughed at General Beard.<br>
“Ha-ha. I guess you are concerning way too much, Beard. I'll not be used by my [tool].”<br>
“Well then, why you introduced your [tool] to the empress?”<br>
General Schidor responded to that question shamelessly saying,<br>
“Well, the empress wanted to see him. That's all I know, Beard.”<br>
“Don't want to speak the truth, huh? Just be careful not to walk into your own trap.”<br>
General Beard walked away.<br>
“I'm not afraid of anything, Beard”<br>
General Schidor talked to himself while he was staring back of General Beard.<br>
|<br>
Dinner party was almost over. Some of participants started to leave.<br>
|<br>
It was wonderful night for General Schidor. He confirmed that there will be no enemy against him in this Empire.<br>
The only matter left for him was to think [when] he put the end to this political conflict.<br>
He was excited to think how to deal with member of [Control Fast] after everything is over.<br>
|<br>
By his excitement, and alcohol he took, his mind was almost in the dream.<br>
That is why he did not recognize that driver of his coach was not the same man as usually.<br>
Also he couldn't recognize a dead body of original driver.<br>
When he stepped into inside of his coach, strange gas started fill inside of coach.<br>
As soon as he noticed that, he tried to escape from his coach, however, doors and all of windows were dead locked from outside.<br>
General Schidor lost his consciousness.<br>
Assassination by [Control Fast] succeeded.<br>
[Control Fast]lost their power after officer Kamdon had been assassinated.<br>
So they decided eliminate General Schidor. It was a huge gamble; however, they won this gamble.<br>

Coach ran away to somewhere.<br>
|<br>
Izac was there watching everything. However, he did not try to rescue General Schidor.<br>
He was faithfully following order form Evarist.<br>
|<br>
General Schidor was already useless for Evarist. He decided Schidor to be as the last sacrifice in this political conflict.<br>
Even though he caught plan of this assassination in advance, he did not do anything.<br>
Once again, Schidor had become needless person even in his own party.<br>
Evarist had finished his groundwork already. Main members of [Head-Liner] were on his side.<br>
He will be the top of [Head-Liner] after all.<br>

Evarist came back to party hall after seeing the empress. He went to out on the balcony to cool him down by a night breeze.<br>
Izac came beside of Evarist.<br>
“What happened? Took you long time. Ladies were crying, you lady killer.”<br>
“I'll talk to you later.” Evarist said.<br>
Then Izac showed ironic smile in his face, and said,<br>
“Oh, by the way. <General Schidor had some visitor tonight.>”<br>
It was their secret code meaning that Schidor had been assassinated.<br>
The time has come. Evarist thought that with confidence.<br>

13,27,1,"Year 3392. - Jaws of Death -",1,"Head of murderer, which feared all of citizen in Lonsbrough Kingdom, was connected to weird machine by some kind of threads.<br>
That machine, used to look into other's memory, was created by some [engineer] long time ago.<br>
It was able be use on dead body if there is a head. Perhaps, Rofen was the only one who owns this kind of weird machine around the world.<br>
|<br>
“What a useless machine. Are you sure it's not broken, Rofen?”<br>
Grunwald said to Rofen. That machine did not show memory of this man's client.<br>
Rofen responded Grunwald's question with his sense of humor.<br>
“It seems working fine. This one looks as old as I am, but it does an excellent job, just like I do.”<br>
Prince completely ignored old man's joke. Rofen continued,<br>
“Well, can't pull out memory which this guy doesn't even have. His client isn't that stupid, I assume.”<br>
Two men in front of man's head seemed that they are enjoying this weird experiment.<br>
“Give a man cloth and money, and then request indiscriminate murder...Strange, huh?”<br>
Grunwald asked to Rofen.<br>
“Well, there is a man who kill others as his hobby...I feel this is not as strange as that hobby.”<br>
Rofen made joke again to answer Grunwald. Grunwald ignored this time also.<br>
Rofen took upper cloth of man which used to hold man's head and observed it. That cloth was covered with blood; however, it was not a point Rofen wanted to mention.<br>
“Hmm...this cloth is almost as same as yours, isn't it?” Rofen asked to Grunwald.<br>
“No, Rofen. It's not almost the same. It is exactly the same cloth as mine.”<br>
Grunwald answered. Kind of cloth, like prince of kingdom would wear, could not easily owned by anyone. Rofen made his inference.<br>
“The [client] might be in somewhere close to you. Do you have any idea who might be the [client]?”<br>
Grunwald shrugged his shoulders and said,<br>
“Nope, I don't have any idea...There are too many suspects.”<br>
|<br>
Grunwald called all of retainers in castle. They were all bending their knees in front of the prince.<br>
Grunwald threw man's head in front of them.<br>
Terrible smell of rotten head started to fill in the room.<br>
“Oh my...”<br>
One of retainers screamed.<br>
Grunwald started to speak without any expression as usual.<br>
“Murderer had been executed, by me. Tragedy like this will not occur in town, anymore. Tell all of citizen.”<br>
Sir Gaius stiffened his face and he tried to speak.<br>
“Well, this is...”<br>
Sir Gaius could not finish his word.<br>
“Do you have anything to say, Sir Gaius?”<br>
Grunwald asked to Gaius.<br>
“...I will take any punishment.”<br>
He was looking into Grunwald's eyes when he said it.<br>
“Take this head, Gaius. It will be a nice ornament in your room.”<br>
The prince left the room, leaving stunned retainers there.<br>
|<br>
“Did retainers say anything?”<br>
Rofen asked Grunwald as soon as he saw Grunwald came in to the room.<br>
“Nothing” Grunwald said.<br>
“Well, they believe they are doing right thing. They don't need you, poor prince.”<br>
Rofen's blunt word made Grunwald smile wryly.<br>
“It will be all fine if I disappear, huh?” Grunwald asked Rofen.<br>
“I can't deny that point.” Rofen answered.<br>
Grunwald took a long breath and said,<br>
“Ridiculous game...I shouldn't of come back here, don't you think?”<br>
“I don't think so, prince. There will be your duty as a royal family will begin anytime soon.”<br>
Rofen made a prediction.<br>
|<br>
Prediction of Rofen became true.<br>
A special envoy from Lubiana Kingdom had arrived few days later. It was request for reinforcements.<br>
Granddillenia Empire raised their army and started to expand their territory. Lubiana Kingdom was the first target.<br>
All of retainers gathered up in front of prince and started to discuss about situation.<br>
After a while, they decided to send advance army because if Lubiana Kingdom defeated by Granddillenia Empire, Lonsbrough Kingdom will be in danger next.<br>
And also Lonsbrough Kingdom and Lubiana Kingdom were allied with each other for a long time.<br>
|<br>
Now they started to argue who will be in command of advance army.<br>
Grunwald was sitting on the throne and he was listening to their argument silently.<br>
When the argument heated up, Grunwald suddenly opened his mouth and said,<br>
“I will be commander of advance army.”<br>
Even though his voice was not loud, it made silence in the room.<br>
After couple of seconds, all of retainer started to persuading prince not to be in advance army.<br>
“This young prince is showing his determination to face against this national crisis! We are here to support this brave young prince, aren't we?”<br>
Rofen's speech stopped retainers.<br>
“Sir Gaius. You stay here. Take care of the king.”<br>
Grunwald said to Sir Gaius, and stood up.<br>
“Yes, your highness.”<br>
Sir Gaius responded politely.<br>
|<br>
It took 5 days to form advance army.<br>
Soldiers, conscripted from entire kingdom, were lining up in front of castle.<br>
Commanding officer of advance army was shouting. All soldiers responded Commanding officer's shout by screaming.<br>
Beside of Commanding officer, Grunwald kept his eyes closed for all of the time.<br>
|<br>
Rofen muttered from top of gateway, looking down ceremony.<br>
“This is the time to show your might, [Black Prince].”<br>

14,17,1,"Year 3397. - A Garden -",1,"After the dinner party, Evarist and empress Alicetaria started to meet each other sometimes.<br>
Today also, they were walking in corridor together.<br>
Alicetaria walked forward and Evarist followed her slowly in a little bit of distance.<br>
Even though they had short limited time to see each other, distance between them had become closer day after day.<br>
“So, have you thought about what I told you before, Evarist?”<br>
Empress turned around and asked Evarist.<br>
“Yes, I did. I am more than welcome to take that offer.”<br>
Evarist responded quickly with no hesitation.<br>
“That is good. I need you, Evarist.” Empress smiled tenderly.<br>
“It is my honor.”<br>
Evarist did not trust her completely. He had found dark sorrow inside of her beautiful eyes.<br>
Also her position in Empire was deep inside of it.<br>
Even so, Evarist decided to stay close to her.<br>
He believed this relationship will give him a huge advantage.<br>
|<br>
A corridor was filled with light of setting sun.<br>
Two shadows, shadow of empress and shadow of young knight, became as one.<br>
|<br>
As soon Izac saw Evarist coming in to the room, he started to complain.<br>
“That was stupid. Thanks for making me feel like I am one of bonehead who likes to peep!”<br>
“I'm sorry, Izac. Forgive me.” Evarist was the one who made Izac to watch their secret meeting.<br>
“Can't trust that lady.” Instead of forgiving Evarist, Izac mentioned his doubt towards empress.<br>
He did not feel good to be on a scheme which empress had planned.<br>
“I'm not trusting her blindly. Situation is under control, don't worry.” Evarist said.<br>
Izac ignored what Evarist said and brought up his question.<br>
“You know what? I was searching for [Custode] while you guys were having fun.<br>
None of them were around. None of them. Don't you feel something is wrong there?”<br>
[Custode], Izac mentioned was the group of high-class soldiers which guards loyal family. He could not think that [Custode] had not noticed action of Evarist.<br>
Izac said to Evarist,<br>
“I feel like they are seeing through us...like everything.”<br>
“What are they seeing through? Are they seeing through our past or our ambition?<br>
We don't need to be afraid anymore.” Evarist started to heat up.<br>
“Now you're excited, huh? You're too serious about it, don't you realize? ”<br>
Evarist responded right away.<br>
“I'm too serious? What do you mean, Izac?”<br>
Evarist showed his anger.<br>
“Look the mirror. Check yourself.”<br>
Izac left the room.<br>
|<br>
Few days later.<br>
Evarist was promoted as brigadier general. He already had enough efforts and enough capacity of himself.<br>
And now the empress is backing him up.<br>
His power in imperial force was becoming stronger and stronger in each day.<br>
The empress placed new rank insignia on Evarist's a military uniform.<br>
Thunderous applause occurred in ceremony hall.<br>
A young hero of Granddillenia Empire became the youngest general in Empire history.<br>
Even though all of participants of this ceremony knew that Evarist could not make this achievement without his patron, who was the empress, they welcomed this young General.<br>
However, Izac, who always stayed with Evarist like his shadow, was not in ceremony hall.<br>
|<br>
At the night, Evarist found Izac in a garden.<br>
He was practicing his sword technique.<br>
“Practicing hard, huh?” Evarist talked to Izac.<br>
Evarist was senior to Izac in just one rank, before. However, now there was a huge gap in between their ranks.<br>
“You could just call me down, General Waltz.” Izac responded politely.<br>
He had never spoken to Evarist like this in their private.<br>
Evarist ignored Izac's polite attitude.<br>
“If you want to say something, just speak, Izac.” Evarist said.<br>
“I have nothing to say, Evarist. My word does not mean anything to you, right?”<br>
Izac did not stop practicing and did not even see Evarist's face either.<br>
Evarist took a wooden sword and pointed to Izac.<br>
“I need some practice. Come on Izac, bring it on.” Evarist said.<br>
Without saying anything, Izac took his position.<br>
|<br>
Sound of swinging sword and sound of knocking wood started to break silence of the night.<br>
It continued for a while.<br>
When two man jumped away to take distance, Evarist was breathing hard.<br>
Izac talked to Evarist.<br>
“You got rusty, huh? Too much of desk works?”<br>
“I'm not done, yet!”<br>
As soon Evarist said, he swung his sword with special power.<br>
Evarist had named this special attack as [Torpedo Attack].<br>
It stuns opponent with special power.<br>
Intensive impact drove through Izac's arm. He dropped his wooden sword.<br>
“Hey! That was a crafty attack!” Izac shouted.<br>
Evarist put his wooden sword in front of Izac, and said,<br>
“It called as [carelessness], Izac.”<br>
Under unspoken agreement, they did not use this kind of special force which they had obtained long ago.<br>
“We can't run away from the past. I'll never forget.”<br>
Evarist threw his wooden sword and he gave his hand to Izac.<br>
Izac ignored that and stood up by himself.<br>
“I'll never forget it, too!”<br>
Izac shouted.<br>
They were facing each other without any words for a while.<br>
Izac shook his head once, and pierced his wooden sword to the ground.<br>
“Good bye, Eva.”<br>
He called Evarist as he did long time ago.<br>
And then he walked away from Evarist.<br>

15,37,1,"Year 3395. - A Letter -",1,"Abel opened his eyes.<br>
It was just before the sunrise. Irene was sleeping beside of him.<br>
Abel met Irene in some inn on the way of Meriguadia.<br>
Irene said that she is daughter of some nobles, on the way back to Meriguadia.<br>
Abel quietly, not to awake Irene, took a letter from headboard and started to read.<br>
It was a letter from his best friend.<br>
|<br>
“You can be serious. I didn't know that.”<br>
Irene teased Abel. She was awaked by noise Abel made.<br>
“I'm always serious, honey.”<br>
Abel threw his letter away and held Irene in his arm.<br>
“Really? I don't think so, sweet heart.”<br>
Abel kissed Irene to close her mouth.<br>
|<br>
Abel received a letter about two days ago.<br>
It was delivered to caravan.<br>
No one would know that he is guarding this caravan; however, the name of sender was familiar to him. It was from Leon.<br>
Leon said to meet each other in Meriguadia in his letter.<br>
He did not write in detail, but his messy handwriting was showing evidence of his urgent problem.<br>
If there are any problems, Abel will help Leon, no matter what.<br>
It was only a couple of years spend together; however, Abel felt that Leon saved Abel from dissolute life.<br>
That was why Abel wanted to be Leon's help this time.<br>
|<br>
Caravan arrived to Meriguadia.<br>
Leader of caravan finished trading.<br>
Products changed into money. When the leader found Abel, he said,<br>
“Well! This is your payment! You did a great job! Thanks!”<br>
There was great amount of money which more than Abel expected.<br>
When he looked face of leader dubiously, leader opened his mouth.<br>
“Well, that's how I pay to experts. You see? I'm doing big enough business to pay you that much.”<br>
Leader showed a little bit of his pride, and he continued,<br>
“Well there will be this kind of trade for a while. Can you continue to be our caravan guard? Of cause I will pay as much as I just did, or even more. How does it sound?”<br>
Abel pretended thinking. His answer had already made up.<br>
“Sorry, I can't take your offer this time. I've got something to do here.”<br>
Leader of caravan sighed with disappointment; however, once he raised his face again, he had his usual smile in his face.<br>
“Well, we are staying here for a couple of days. Let me know if you changed your mind!”<br>
Caravan started to move away.<br>
As soon as they are gone, Irene came beside of Abel and she wrapped her arm to Abel's waist.<br>
“Come to my house, honey.” Irene whispered.<br>
“That's a good idea, but sorry. I have something to do.” Abel answered.<br>
“Is that important?”<br>
“Yes, it is. I'm meeting my old friend here.”<br>
“Oh, OK...We can meet after, right?”<br>
“Why not, honey.”<br>
Abel hugged Irene.<br>
|<br>
Abel was at the bar which Leon had named in his letter.<br>
Leon did not show up that night.<br>
Abel waited him for 3 days there. Leon never showed up.<br>
Abel was not worrying about Leon, but he had to make new plan if Abel keeps not showing up.<br>
He started wondering around in the city thinking about his new plan.<br>
|<br>
When he noticed, he was in slum area which he usually doesn't go in.<br>
After a while of thinking time, he continued wondering around to kill his time.<br>
He felt a right impact in his back.<br>
A boy who bumped into Abel had passed him quickly without saying anything.<br>
Abel saw that boy was smiling just before he disappears into an alley.<br>
He looked down his waist. His leather bag with all of his money had disappeared.<br>
Even though, he was drunk and he was in carelessness, the fact that his wallet got stolen by little boy made him mad.<br>
“Crap!!!”<br>
Abel shouted once and started to run after that boy.<br>
He quickly passed alley and came to other street. Boy was not there.<br>
Abel closed his eyes. He started to use his sharpened sense to search that boy.<br>
When he found the feeling of that boy, he started to run again.<br>
|<br>
Abel heard shout of someone from alley.<br>
In that alley, three punks were surrounding that boy.<br>
Abel decided to watch.<br>
“I will not let you get away, this time!”<br>
When leader of those punks shouted, all of them pulled their sword.<br>
Abel thought that it was a little too much, but he continued to watch.<br>
Boy seemed that he was not afraid of them. He even had some enjoyment in his face.<br>
“Be careful! This kid uses some weird power!”<br>
Leader of pucks shouted.<br>
“I know!”<br>
When they finished their conversation, one of punks threw a net to their target.<br>
That boy was trapped in the net. It seemed that it was hard for him to get out.<br>
“OK! Kill him!!! Kill him, NOW!!!”<br>
Leader shouted.<br>
At this point, Abel stepped on in front of punks, and he said,<br>
“Well he is just a kid. You don't have to kill him, don't you think?”<br>
Abel had a skill to feel one's murderous intent. According to his skill, those punks were seriously trying to kill that boy, and he did not want to let that happen.<br>
“This is none of your business! Get away or we'll kill you also!”<br>
Leader shouted.<br>
Abel ignored it, and pulled out his sword with deep sigh.<br>

Tormentor saluted to him. And then head chief said,<br>
“That's it. We will release him.”<br>
At first tormentor could not understand what head chief said.<br>
Tormentor looked Leon's face and chief's head reciprocally.<br>
Then he started to complain.<br>
“Chief! Please give me at least an hour. I can make him speak!”<br>
However, the chief did not respond to tormentor's entreaty.<br>
Chief pointed a man who is standing behind of him.<br>
There was a man wearing white uniform of [Engineer].<br>
“Can you release him quickly? ”<br>
Engineer said in a frigid manner.<br>
Tormentor threw Leon's belonging and cloth after releasing Leon.<br>
Leon caught it. He looked he could barely stand up.<br>
“...Ah...It's you...”<br>
Leon said to engineer when his hazy sight caught him.<br>
“Well, just take a rest for while. You look very bad there.” Engineer said.<br>
Even though Leon was released, he had no energy so he passed out before hearing all of engineer's word.<br>
He tumbled down slowly.<br>
|<br>
Two days had passed after being released from jail.<br>
Leon woke up on the bed.<br>
“Oh, you are awake. You are sleeping for two days.”<br>
Leon turned his head to direction of that voice.<br>
There was a young nurse standing beside of his bed.<br>
Also he recognized some medical instruments around him.<br>
Leon asked nurse,<br>
“Where is this?”<br>
Nurse responded quickly. She said,<br>
“This is medical office in prison of Aiakos. Please give me moment. I'll call Mr. Lahm.”<br>
When he heard that name, his mind became clear.<br>
It was the name of engineer who rescued Leon from jail.<br>
|<br>
Engineer Lahm came in to medical office. As soon as Lahm saw Leon's face, he said,<br>
“How do you feel, Leon? Are you alright?”<br>
“I still can't believe you helped me, Lahm.” Leon smiled slightly.<br>
“I didn't want waste the life of man like you.”<br>
“How did you know I was in jail?” Leon asked.<br>
“You guys robbed belonging of [Engineer]. Of cause I'd hear the name of robber.”<br>
“Oh...Was it engineer's caravan?”<br>
“I guess you didn't know what was inside of carriage, huh?”<br>
Leon did not say anything to that question.<br>
Lahm looked in to Leon's face for a while, and he continued,<br>
“I know its Archibald who made you eat a crap. What a nice friend, huh?”<br>
“Well, he will be properly deserved...I will make him eat crap at least twice.”<br>
Lahm laughed.<br>
“Ha-ha. But be careful, Archibald is not easy guy to handle.”<br>
“Archibald...what was he aiming for?” Leon asked.<br>
“That's the thing you shouldn't really know...”<br>
Lahm evaded Leon's question. Leon took a deep breath once, and said,<br>
“You guys always keep things in secret, huh? Doing something bad there?”<br>
“That's how we managing our power, Leon.”<br>
After saying that, Lahm started to speak about his main issue.<br>
“I know you are wounded badly, but I have one thing I want you to do.”<br>
“It depends what you want me to do, Lahm. I need some peaceful time.”<br>
“Well, it's not that tough. I just want you to take [something] to [somewhere].”<br>
Lahm called his man.<br>
After a while, his man came into medical room with hand-sized wooden box.<br>
“This one. We need to do this in order to help [someone].”<br>
“Take [something] to [somewhere] for [someone]? It sounds just like engineer. Where I'm going to?”<br>
Leon made his question ironically.<br>
Lahm answered that ironic question in serious tone.<br>
“That [somewhere] will be [The Eye] of Profound.<br>
Ironic smile disappeared from Leon, and he said,<br>
“It vanished with main force of Regiment.”<br>
“Yes, place where the main force of Regiment vanished at the end. But that place became important, now.”<br>
[The Eye] was the last Profound to be vanished.<br>
Also it was a place where the main force of Regiment had total destruction.<br>
It was beginning of [Dawn-light Age].<br>
|<br>
“Even though, [Profound] is gone, it is still dangerous to go there.” Lahm said.<br>
Monsters which called by [Profound] were still remained there.<br>
They are decreasing their numbers, however, none of humans, or nations were trying to go there.<br>
|<br>
“I want you to go there, and set this devise.” Lahm said with serious tone.<br>
“Well well...thing is getting big.” Leon smiled wryly.<br>
“You can do this, Leon. You are the [Regiment] who survived that tragedy.”<br>
Leon started to think deeply. Then he opened his mouth.<br>
“You saved me twice now, huh?”<br>
Regiment dissolved after vanishing of [Profound] and its main force.<br>
There was young regiments, who did not join main force, remained all after.<br>
“Everyone would be executed if you weren't there.” Leon said.<br>
“Well, yes. I didn't see the reason of young Regiments been executed.”<br>
“I own you, right? Well, I guess this is my payback time.”<br>
Leon smiled to Lahm.<br>
“Thanks, Leon.”<br>
“No problem...So, what I should do with that devise?”<br>
“My man will explain to you.”<br>
Lahm called his man again, and he started to explain about the devise.<br>
|<br>
“I am counting on you! Leon”<br>
Lahm shouted from his coach.<br>
Leon was looking a coach untill it disappeared from his sight.<br>
And then Leon started to prepare for his journey.<br>
Tormenter was staring at Leon from behind the gate.<br>
There was nothing around prison of Aiakos, besides the wasteland.<br>
“Well...”<br>
Leon took a deep breath and started to walk.<br>
His backpack felt much heavier than before.<br>
Leon had lost some of his strength by the life in jail.<br>

“Mr. Iosif. We are ready for departure.”<br>
A young officer reported to Mr. Iosif politely.<br>
He responded to young officer.<br>
Mr. Iosif seemed around age of mid forty. His coat was fluttering in strong wind.<br>
He did not know how high this flying city Pandemonium was flying.<br>
Strong wind was blowing in fight deck.<br>
Young officer started to talk to Mr. Iosif.<br>
“I thought you just came back from under-world. You have to go back there already?”<br>
“Yes, I have to go back there to fix something.”<br>
“You mean [Galleon]? Once that flying battle ship become active, it will change whole situations of under-world, doesn't it?”<br>
“Yes, it will change dramatically. It will be easy to control them.”<br>
Both of them continued to talk while young officer was final checking for this flight.<br>
“So how is it like to live in under-world? Is that tough, you think?”<br>
“I don't think it is tough, well, it is part of my job. But I can say here is much more comfortable than under-world for sure.”<br>
“I have never lived in under-world. I admire you Mr. Iosif.”<br>
“It is dusty and dirty world. I recommend you to stay here.”<br>
They stopped talking when young officer called by control cabin.<br>
Mr. Iosif started to look into the sky through window.<br>
He was thinking about conversation with his son, Kronig, last night.<br>
Last night, his son confessed that he had been suffering by weird illusion.<br>
When he advised his son to see the mental doctor, he received an emergency call from Lonsbrough.<br>
Conversation ended there without having any conclusion.<br>
Because he was being busy preparing himself for this flight, he could not see son's face in this morning.<br>
“We are all ready to go. Please put your sheet belt on.”<br>

His father left dining room and he did not show his face in front of Kronig anymore.<br>
In the morning of next day, his father was already gone leaving a note saying<br>
“Called down to under-world. I'll give you a call A.S.A.P.”<br>
It broke Kronig's last hope.<br>
He hoped his father, as high-ranked engineer, to show him solution of his illusion disaster.<br>
When he was thinking like that, his father came home in good timing.<br>
Then he decided to confess his problem to his father.<br>
That was last night, and he is gone already.<br>

Kronig did not have conversation with his father in couple of years now.<br>
He almost forgot how to speak with him...He even sweats to be in the same room with his father.<br>
He used all of his courage to ask for help.<br>
However, his father did not help him enough.<br>
|<br>
Kronig thought to visit psychiatrist who his father mentioned.<br>
He denied that idea right away. He shook his head once.<br>
He stopped walking in front of theater.<br>
He used this theater every time after suffering his illusion.<br>
Even though, he was not interested into movies or plays, he felt some kind of calmness every time when he saw the story based on a fiction.<br>
After having terrible illusions, those fiction stories had become more stable reality for Kronig.<br>
Theater was his last fort.<br>
He stepped into theater without any thinking.<br>
|<br>
Kronig was only audience in the theater.<br>
He was sitting in the center of movie hall.<br>
He realized that he did not even checked title of movie, but he did not feel like to move. He was watching movie absentmindedly.<br>
|<br>
When the story reached its climax...<br>
Kronig recognized the existence of his illusion.<br>
Realty of the world had quickly disappeared.<br>
“...I can't get away...”<br>
Kronig whispered despairingly.<br>
This theater was the only place where Kronig could find peaceful time.<br>
The world in the movie started to be distorted.<br>
Boundary line of [realty] and [illusion] had vanished.<br>
Where is realty? Where is illusion?<br>
What is real? What is fiction?<br>
Kronig had lost his realty of his world.<br>

Kronig called it as [Phantom Beast] since he saw it in the library of Technocrat.<br>
It had three lifeless eyes in center of its face. Huge mouth, with sharp fangs, was moving grossly.<br>
Body had almost the same figure as amphibian animals; however, none of creature like this had existed in real life.<br>
|<br>
It started appear in Kronig's sight frequently.<br>
It was just staring at Kronig.<br>
This time its behavior was all same as usual.<br>
Kronig did not pay attention to this creature. He continued to watch movie which was like his ideal land.<br>
“How can I make you disappeared?” He whispered.<br>
He did not expected any response to his monologue...However,<br>
<You want me to disappear? You are the one who wanted me, aren't you?><br>
[Phantom Beast] responded to Kronig.<br>
|<br>
Kronig trembled with great fear.<br>
He had never thought that this [Phantom Beast] would have a mind to speak.<br>
He did not think he would be able of communicate.<br>
While Kronig was trembling, [Phantom Beast] continued to talk.<br>
<You are unneeded. No one wants you. That's why you wanted me to be here...right?><br>
“NO!!! What are you talking about?”<br>
Kronig shouted reflexively.<br>
<Don't get so irritated, my friend...><br>
It narrowed its three eyes all at once. It seemed that it smiled.<br>
As soon as Kronig saw it, he felt that fiction took over his realty.<br>
And then it asked to Kronig,<br>
|<br>
[Hey, do you want to remake this world?]<br>

18,107,1,"Year 3390. - Doctor -",1,"When Sheri opened her eyes, she saw the unfamiliar ceiling.<br>
She was in the small room with only bed and the door.<br>
She felt that she became alone in parallel universe.<br>
When she turned around to check her situation, she recognized bandage wrapped her wrist.<br>
She touched her wrist, but she did not feel any pain.<br>
|<br>
She was sitting on the bed not thinking anything for a while.<br>
And then she started to hear some sound like something is breathing hard outside of the room.<br>
Weird imagination popped in her head.<br>
“Maybe people who I killed had come back for their revenge...”<br>
She got up from bed slowly and walked towards the door and slowly opened it. Something jumped to her chest vigorously.<br>
She was surprised and fell on her behind.<br>
It was dog like object which jumped on her.<br>
It was shaking its tail just like common dog and started to rick her face.<br>
She was stunning by surprise for a while.<br>
That object was ricking her face still.<br>
When she came back to herself, she put that object away forcibly, and wiped her face. The feel of this object's body was almost the same as doll, but behavior was just like a dog.<br>
It started to running around of her.<br>
She went outside of the room with that weird [dog].<br>
Hallway in this building was clean and well-lighted.<br>
|<br>
After a while of walking hallway, she arrived to blight room.<br>
In the room, she found many kinds of trees in the center of the room.<br>
Also, she found silver desk, with mysterious tools and documents on it, around the trees. And most interesting thing was many of human dolls in glass case.<br>
|<br>
Sheri recognized some man wearing white coat came out from shade of glass case.<br>
As soon he found Sheri, He started to walk towards to her.<br>
“Well, you seem just fine. I was surprised when Mr. Giblyn called me.”<br>
After saying that, he recognized [dog] staying beside of Sheri.<br>
“Ah, Rob liked you. He didn't like any of my visitors...or even me...”<br>
He continued,<br>
“Please be nice to him. He has a lot of functions like you do.”<br>
As soon as he said it, he turned around and started to walk towards to his work benches.<br>
“Where is this? And who are you?” Sheri stopped the man.<br>
He stopped walking and turned around to Sheri. And he said,<br>
“Oops. This is your first time here, I forgot that...” He continued,<br>
“My name is Dr. Walken. You can just call me [Doctor]. I am the one created Rob and you.”<br>
Sheri couldn't understand what he just said.<br>
Doctor kept explaining the situation.<br>
“You had stopped all of your functions by loosing great amount of inner liquid.”<br>
Sheri put her hand on to her wrist unconsciously.<br>
“I received a call from Mr. Giblyn, and then I corrected you and fixed your trouble.”<br>
Doctor smiled once and said,<br>
“Please think this is your own home. Help yourself if you need something. Let's have a tea time after I finished with my work.”<br>
Then he walked away from Sheri.<br>
|<br>
There were two cups on the white table under bright skylight.<br>
A girl wearing white coat, looked same age as Sheri, served hot tea and milk.<br>
“You will never die...like normal human.”<br>
Doctor said while he was drinking tea.<br>
He looked Sheri's face, and continued.<br>
“You will be stalled, but I can fix that.”<br>
Sheri was staring at tea while she was listening to Doctor.<br>
She did not speak anything.<br>
“You totally went out side of my expectation, Sheri. I'd never imagined that my child would obtain such a strong emotion to commit suicide.”<br>
Doctor showed his excitement.<br>
“Is there any meaning of living?”<br>
Sheri whispered.<br>
“Well, that is a good question. But I can't answer. Well, I should say, I don't have the answer. You need to find the answer by yourself. It sounds irresponsible, but hey, scientist like me is always irresponsible, don't you think?”<br>
After saying that, he turned around and called,<br>
“Donita! Come here.”<br>
Donita responded quickly.<br>
“Yes, Doctor.”<br>
She came beside of Doctor.<br>
“This is Donita. She is your sister.” Doctor introduced.<br>
“Nice to meet you, Sheri. I am your older sister...maybe.”<br>
Donita bowed elegantly.<br>
“I want to do some research on you, and also want to test some of new functions. You will be living here for a while. Please ask Donita if you have any questions or requests.”<br>
Doctor stood up from chair and went back to work.<br>
Donita talked to Sheri with smile.<br>
“We are only two automata in active here. Let's have fun together.”<br>
|<br>
Doctor had visitor one day.<br>
Large wooden boxes were carried out.<br>
Visitor was wearing uniform which Sheri had never seen before.<br>
Sheri knew that automaton was inside of wooden box.<br>
Sheri tried to talk to them because they were the same kind as Sheri.<br>
However, they had never responded to Sheri.<br>
Unfortunately, she started to think those as objects.<br>
|<br>
Sheri was listening to conversation between Doctor and visitor stealthily.<br>
“How are my children doing? All fine?”<br>
“They are doing well, more than I expected. Some officers are saying they want to have more. Shortage of soldier is big issue in Pandemonium also.”<br>
“I can create that type anytime. Just send me order. Also I am always welcome about special order.”<br>
“Well, then. I have some special order here...I want you to make automaton exactly same as some person...”<br>
|<br>
“Aren't you supposed to be cleaning up?”<br>
Sheri jumped once and turned around.<br>
There was Donita standing with broom in her hand.<br>
Doctor did not order Sheri to work like house maid, but Donita did.<br>
“It is our task to serve Doctor. You can't just stand and do nothing. It's not good!”<br>
Donita was restless girl.<br>
Doctor said that stories, which Doctor read to Donita when she was just created, made her like that.<br>
Sheri liked to be in calm, so she did not fit well to Donita's style.<br>
Rob started to bark threateningly at Donita.<br>
“You are bad dog. You need some punishment?”<br>
Donita attempted to slap Rob by bloom.<br>
Sheri grub Donita's arm to stop her.<br>
They both lost their valance and fell down on the floor making loud noise.<br>
“You guys! Go outside to play. I'm working now!”<br>
Doctor yelled.<br>
“It's your fault, Sheri.” Donita said.<br>
“No it's not.” Sheri talked back.<br>
They faced each other in short distance.<br>
“Happiness will not come to lazy person.”<br>
Donita walked away from Sheri leaving that word.<br>
“Happiness...What is happiness?”<br>
She whispered and looked down.<br>
She saw Rob relaxing beside of her foot.<br>

19,67,1,"Year 3391. - Guild -",1,"Life of Jead was becoming harder and harder in each day.<br>
All of food and money were gone after few days from the day he escaped from his house.<br>
He was earning money for a day by pickpocketing and stealing.<br>
If he could not earn any money, he ate the leftovers from restaurant which threw away in alley.<br>
The day he felt blight sun shine was gone.<br>
Life of Jead had become a dull just as before.<br>
|<br>
He could have enough money to eat for a while, if he succeeded this pickpocketing.<br>
However he made a mistake. A guy noticed that Jead stealing his money.<br>
Jead ran as hard as he could, but unfortunately, was surrounded by group of scoundrels.<br>
“Dirty kid, huh?” One of scoundrel said.<br>
“Whoever messes with us, will be in a big trouble. That is the rule around here.”<br>
Jead was looking to scoundrels in vacant eyes.<br>
He did not have any vitality to run away anymore.<br>
“Blame your hard luck!”<br>
“Didn't your mother tell you stealing is a bad thing?”<br>
“Don't you ever try to mess with us, punk!”<br>
Scoundrels started to beat Jead up all at once.<br>
Head, face, chest, arms and legs.<br>
Jead was feeling pain everywhere in his body.<br>
Then he started to taste his own blood in his mouth.<br>
|<br>
He felt the same feeling as before while he was losing his consciousness.<br>
“...Hey, he's not breathing.” One of scoundrels said.<br>
“Was it little too much?” Other one seemed little bit scared.<br>
“Who gives a crap? No one would care about this dirty kid.”<br>
Leader of scoundrels spat on Jead's face.<br>
And then they walked away.<br>
|<br>
Jead did not know why and how, the same thing happened as the night when he killed his mother.<br>
Now he was sure that the thing occurred to him in that night was real.<br>
It was happening again.<br>
|<br>
Jead succeeded to steal their money this time.<br>
He avoided his mistake perfectly this time.<br>
He started to count the money in dark alley.<br>
There was enough money to eat for a while.<br>
When he gave a sigh of relief, someone grub his shoulder.<br>
He quickly turned around.<br>
|<br>
There was a portly man with long beard and wavy hair was standing.<br>
“Well well, you did good job there, kid.”<br>
He said. Jead tried to run away, but man's hand grub Jead's shoulder tight and did not released him. And a man said,<br>
“Don't run. I'm not going to hurt you” with powerful voice.<br>
Jead gave up to running away.<br>
“Good boy. I heard there is a kid doing great [job] in my area. I was looking for you.”<br>
Man laughed and continued,<br>
“You know? There are some rules of thieves around here.”<br>
He said that he is the boss of thieves around this area.<br>
He was saying that he will permit Jead to [work] in his area, if he receives some money from Jead's [effort].<br>
|<br>
“Is there any benefit to join your guild?”<br>
Jead asked. The boss laughed once, and he said,<br>
“A benefit you said? Ha-ha. You already know how to survive in slum huh? You will live long, kid”<br>
The boss looked into Jead's eye.<br>
“Well, we can feed you when you don't have any money. And also, we can pay some money to let you out from jail, if you screwed up.”<br>
He smiled once and continued.<br>
“Not everyone can be member of my guild. Need to have skills to join us.”<br>
Jead made his mind quickly.<br>
“Okay, I'll join.”<br>
“Well then! Welcome to my guild! I liked you when I saw you first time. Just follow me. I'll show you my men.”<br>
They started to walk together.<br>
|<br>
After of complicated passage, they arrived to some house in slum.<br>
“This is our [home]. Don't let anyone see you going in. Take someone with you for first couple of times.”<br>
Inside of the house, there were four men sitting in front of bar counter and old man was standing in a counter as bartender.<br>
“Wuz up! Rookie!” “Good to see you.” “Don't talk to me outside, OK?”<br>
They welcomed young rookie of their guild.<br>
Even though this was first time visiting here, Jead felt some kind of nostalgia.<br>
It was dirk and dirty house, but there was warmness.<br>
At the end, boss introduced bartender to Jead.<br>
When Jead looked at him carefully, he noticed this bartender had just one arm.<br>
“This is Grandpa Philip. He is veteran. Ask him for food if you're hungry. It will taste like crap but it's big enough to make you full.”<br>
Grandpa Philip responded quickly.<br>
“My food taste like crap, you said? Your big belly was made by food, you fatty butt.”<br>
Jead could not stop laughing.<br>
Philip had quick look at Jead and asked to the boss.<br>
“Isn't he too young? Got any skills?”<br>
“Don't worry. He stole wallet from punk heads in David family.”<br>
“Oh is that so? Ha-ha! I wish I could see those punk heads crying!”<br>
|<br>
It was the first time of Jead's life to have fellows.<br>
And those fellows became his family after spending life together for half year.<br>
His life became much brighter than it used to be.<br>
One day, Jead talked about his parents to his boss. It was almost penitence.<br>
He was crying while he was talking.<br>
Boss was listening to Jead without saying anything.<br>
When Jead finished talking, Boss held Jead's head in his arm and said,<br>
“You wanted to live. That what you wanted, right? You were right. You did your best for your life.”<br>
Jead started to cry even more after that.<br>
|<br>
A year had passed...<br>
His boss and fellow got killed by member of David family.<br>
Jead heard this terrible news in his own room.<br>
After a year of [working] under the guild, he had earned enough money to rent a room.<br>
Jead flipped out and started to rage against David family.<br>
It did not take long time for him to make up his mind.<br>
He ran out from his room.<br>
“Stop! Jead! You can't do it by yourself! There is no chance to win! Wait for other members!”<br>
Guild member who brought bad news shouted to Jead.<br>
“I don't care! I'll kill them all!!!”<br>
Jead started to run...<br>

After a while...<br>

Blaise reported to his boss about his last mission.<br>
“There was infected person found in Lonsbrough. How did you manage that?”<br>
Officer asked Blaise softly but sharply.<br>
It seemed that Max did not report in detail.<br>
Blaise thought for moment, and he answered.<br>
“I confirmed its existence. That is it, sir”<br>
“You came back without dealing it...Is that what you are saying?”<br>
“This mission was to collect that [thing]. So I decided not to take any risks, sir.”<br>
Officer put his smile away and made troubled face.<br>
“...Alright, If you say so...Let's be it, then.”<br>
Sound of typing stopped. Then officer put his head up and started to talk.<br>
“You did great job. Are you going to see your sister? I heard that she woke up. I hope she will get better, soon.”<br>
Officer had frustrating smile in his face.<br>
“Thank you, sir...”<br>
“Please take this as my gift.”<br>
Officer handed small bag. It was heavier than it looked.<br>
There were many of jewelries inside of that bag.<br>
“You may give it to your sister like that, or you may transfer those into money. Please use it in the way as you wish.”<br>
Blaise bowed deeply once and got out from office.<br>
It was unexpected kindness from his boss.<br>
Blaise thanked him from his heart for first time.<br>
|<br>
He heard that his sister had woken up when he was on under-ground.<br>
This was his first time to meet her after she woke up.<br>
It's been almost four years she was sleeping.<br>
|<br>
In front of the door Blaise took a deep breath once, and he opened the door.<br>
Then he saw his sister was looking to Blaise.<br>
She was not covered by special sheet. Her eyes were open.<br>
She was not sleeping beauty anymore.<br>
“...Melia.”<br>
Blaise called his sister's name. His voice was shaking.<br>
“Yes, Blaise.”<br>
Melia's voice was weak and thin, however she responded clearly to Blaise.<br>
Melia said,<br>
“I'm sorry Blaise...I made you worried so much.”<br>
“No...No...I'm more than happy to be able to speak with you like this...again...Welcome back, Melia.”<br>
Blaise held sister's hand and she held back weakly but surely.<br>
“I can go home once I recovered, right? I want to go home...together.”<br>
Melia said to Blaise.<br>
“Yeah...let's go home together, like we did when we were child.”<br>
Blaise held sister's hand little bit tighter and said to his sister,<br>
“I'm sorry to leave you alone...We'll be always together from now on.”<br>
“...Yes...Yes, Blaise.”<br>
Tears kept floating over her eyes. Blaise was wiping her tears tenderly.<br>
“I wonder about our old house...Oh yeah...I will cook you a dinner when I go home...I don't think I can cook better then mom, though.”<br>
Blaise saw his sister's smile.<br>
|<br>
“I'll see you again, Melia.”<br>
Visiting time had quickly passed.<br>
Blaise had to leave even he did not wanted to.<br>
It was still early for dinner time.<br>
Blaise started to walk around.<br>
|<br>
He had to think about the future.<br>
His sister was actually recovered. However, there was doubt in Blaise' head which is those engineers could of have made her recovery faster.<br>
Or maybe they were controlling her condition.<br>
If so, it might be easy for them to make his sister sleep again.<br>
Blaise know that those [engineers] were using his sister as shackle to keep Blaise under control.<br>
Should I continue to be as Inquisitor?<br>
Or am I able to continue this job?<br>
Blaise asked himself<br>
|<br>
|<br>
<She said she want to go home.<br>
She wants to live like we did before.<br>
Her wish is my wish. I will do anything to make that happened.<br>
But if I continued this job, it will be hard for me to make her wish come true.<br>
I'm also one of infected person.<br>
I was member of Regiments.<br>
I do have special talent which they regarding dangerous.<br>
It is too dangerous to think I am same.<br>
What's going to happen to my sister if I die on a mission?<br>
I don't think they'd continue her treatment.<br>
My death also means my sister's death.<br>
I need to avoid that.><br>
|<br>
<What are engineers would do to me when they finished eliminating all of infected person?<br>
I am also one of them.<br>
I don't think we can go back to under-world.<br>
House arresting will be the best way.<br>
Or else, I will be [eliminated] as other infected person.<br>
I liked to be in Pandemonium but it was only for my sister's cure<br>
...And also this city was the safest place for her.<br>
Do we have place to live here?<br>
No I don't think so.<br>
I am just a dog in chain.<br>
I need to do something.<br>
I need to find the way to get out from this city...!><br>

There was blue sky above Blaise.<br>
He looked up the sky. He usually feels relieved when he sees this sky.<br>
However, today, he felt that it was like heavy canopy which would squash their future.<br>

Archibald shouted. However, no one responded to his shout.<br>
He could not find any dead bodies.<br>
The main camp had been annihilated, but there was no evidence of fight.<br>
Resistance might have been escaped before attack, Archibald thought.<br>
“Will...Is there...”<br>
“We have couple of meeting place...let's go. We need to check.”<br>
Palatine mentioned about meeting point before Archibald finished his question.<br>
“OK...Let's check from close one.”<br>
Palantine seemed tired, but they had to move.<br>
They need to catch them as soon as possible.<br>
Kingdom army might be chasing after them.<br>
Fortunately, even though Palatine looked tired, condition of his disease was stable.<br>
|<br>
On a running horse, Archibald asked Palantine.<br>
“Hey, Will...What would you do if I say there might be the cure for [Gould]?”<br>
Palantine responded doubtfully,<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
“It not bad to take a chance...even it is very small.”<br>
Archibald was thinking that medical technology of [engineers], lives in flying city Pandemonium, might be able to cure [Gould].<br>
Or he can take Palatine to medical team of Regiment, also.<br>
“...That's fine Archibald...Revolution is almost there...I don't need to live long.”<br>
“I know couple of doctors...They are [engineer]...They might be able to...”<br>
Archibald was not so sure if those engineers would give their treatment to stranger or not.<br>
However, at least they can try, he thought.<br>
“Sorry, Archi...I'm...too tired...”<br>
Palantine denied Archibald's offer in a feeble voice.<br>
Archibald stopped persuading him, and let horse running without any words.<br>
|<br>
Archibald noticed existence of beasts.<br>
They were surrounded.<br>
He had not paying enough attention because he was in hurry.<br>
Those beasts had huge ears like rabbit and short sharp horn.<br>
They must been from the other world behind [Profound].<br>
They looked very excited somehow.<br>
|<br>
If Archibald was by himself, he could eliminate them without any problems.<br>
However he decided not to make over action with Palatine in his back.<br>
“Hold me tight, Will.” Archibald warned Palatine.<br>
|<br>
Beasts were slowly getting closer...<br>
Archibald grub reins tightly and he pulled out his gun.<br>
One of beast started to charge. It had great power and speed.<br>
The ground started to shake. Archibald fired his gun.<br>
However, it did not shoot trough beast's skin.<br>
Beast was still charging to Archibald.<br>
Without any agitation, Archibald changed his target.<br>
He shot the shadow of beast this time. Beast stopped charging and fell down.<br>
His special shot also made other beast confused.<br>
While other they were confusing, Archibald made his way out from encirclement.<br>
|<br>
They arrived to small town.<br>
Both Archibald and Palantine got off from their horse.<br>
“Is this it?” Archibald asked.<br>
“Yeah...We made this town.” Palantine answered proudly.<br>
Palatine walked to gatekeeper, staring at them doubtfully, and started to talk to him.<br>
“Hey, it's me, Palantine. Can you open the gate?”<br>
“...!!! Yes, sir!”<br>
Gatekeeper noticed Palatine's face quickly and started to open the gate.<br>
|<br>
As soon as they went inside of town, all of residents and soldiers started to cheer Palantine.<br>
He was waving his hand to crowds.<br>
He did not show any distress of his disease.<br>
Archibald thought that even though Palatine said that revolution will be succeeded without him, these people need him.<br>
Archibald recognized some familiar face who he met in main camp in the crowd.<br>
“I guess fellows in main camp escaped to here, huh?” Archibald mentioned.<br>
“Ah...That's great.” Palatine smiled brightly.<br>
|<br>
They found a woman outside of crowd. Archibald knew her well.<br>
“Sheila!”<br>
“Will!”<br>
They called each other's name and Sheila run into Palatine and hugged tightly.<br>
“I thought I can't see you anymore...”<br>
“Don't cry, Sheila...”<br>
“How is your body?”<br>
“I'm exhausted this time...I feel it is almost over...”<br>
“You will be fine, Will...Please take a rest.”<br>
After their conversation, Sheila turned around to Archibald and said,<br>
“Thank you so much Archibald...I can't thank you enough...”<br>
Sheila was the one who sent letter to Archibald.<br>
It had been long time since last time he met her.<br>
“Well...I just wanted to see his face. So, don't worry.” Archibald said.<br>
“Thank you very much...Now family became as one.”<br>
Archibald noticed some change in her body.<br>
“Wait...Family you said...Is there a new member of your family?”<br>
Archibald mentioned.<br>
“You have a baby?” Palantine asked Sheila in surprise.<br>
“Yes, Will...New life...Your child is in me.”<br>
Sheila smiled brightly and responded to Palantine.<br>
Palatine hugged Sheila again.<br>
Archibald felt that vitality had come back to Palantine.<br>
|<br>
“Come on...Stay with Sheila tonight, dude.”<br>
In a bar, Archibald blamed Palatine.<br>
“She is already sleeping...Must been tired.”<br>
“Hey...think about your treatment once again.” Archibald said.<br>
“Well...yeah”<br>
A look of uncertainty passed across Palantine' face.<br>
It was unusual for him to be like this.<br>
Archibald kept talking.<br>
“You can't just leave Sheila and your kid, don't you think?”<br>
Palatine closed his eyes for a while and answered.<br>
“Yes, you're right. Can I take your offer now?”<br>
“Of cause, dude. No problem at all.”<br>
“Thanks” Palantine smiled.<br>
“OK then, let's have a shot! For Sheila, for your kid, and for your life!”<br>
Archibald ordered two shots. When both of them were ready, they shouted,<br>
“Cheers!!!”<br>

Palatine was sitting on the chair in front of flying ship which owned by [engineer].<br>
He was having last lecture of his treatment.<br>
“Keep this in mind...The treatment method of [Gould] is still under development. No one can predict what will happen...Are you sure you want to do this?”<br>
“I don't care Mr. Lahm...There is the future I want to see. I want to bet everything on this.”<br>
Lahm nodded deeply.<br>
|<br>
Palatine and Lahm started to go up the stairs.<br>
Just before Palatine goes inside of flying ship, he turned around and shouted to Archibald.<br>
“Thank a lot Archibald! I can't thank you enough!”<br>
“Just buy me couple of drinks when you come back! Take care!!! Everyone is waiting for you!!!”<br>
Archibald shouted back.<br>

“Where's commanders!!! Aren't they here, yet?”<br>
Monsters were becoming more active to avoid disappearance of [Profound].<br>
Limit was almost there.<br>
“We're going to be caught in disappearance!! Can't stay here any longer!!!”<br>
“Run!!! Run!!!”<br>
When they decided to evacuate, their flying ship stopped idling.<br>
“Crap!! How is yours?”<br>
“No! Mine's out, too!!!”<br>
All of their flying ship seemed to have the same trouble.<br>
|<br>
“Eva!!!”<br>
Izac defended Evarist from monster's attack from his blind spot.<br>
He guarded first attack, but he failed to avoid second one.<br>
It scratched Izac's right eye deeply.<br>
“Ugh!!!”<br>
Izac groaned with pain.<br>
“Izac!!! Are you alright?”<br>
Evarist shouted to Izac.<br>
“I'm alright...It's just a scratch.”<br>
He responded to Evarist, and then he ripped edge of his cloth.<br>
He used it as bandage to wrap his right eye.<br>
Quickly his blood dyed that cloth deep red.<br>
It was clear that Izac was wounded badly.<br>
|<br>
Monster noticed that Regiments had lost their ways to evacuate.<br>
They started to attack Regiments even harder.<br>
“Come here!!! Ride on!!!”<br>
When Evarist made up his mind to fight till death, he heard familiar voice which would be never heard in a battle field like this.<br>
In the flying ship, Evarist found [Technocrat] Lahm, who never should be in battle field.<br>
Evarist and Izac ran to flying ship.<br>
“Why you are here?” Evarist asked to Lahm.<br>
Lahm interrupted that question by rapid talking.<br>
“Get in! We don't have time to chat!! Need to carry as many as I can!!!”<br>
Both Evarist and Izac jumped on to flying ship.<br>
|<br>
When flying ship reached to safe point, Lahm dropped two young Regiments.<br>
“This is how far I can go...Need to go back there for other members!”<br>
Lahm shouted from inside of flying ship.<br>
“And do not come back to Regiment!! Hide yourself somewhere!”<br>
Lahm left that word when flying ship started to turn around.<br>
|<br>
As soon as flying ship is gone, Izac started to groan even harder.<br>
“Ugh!”<br>
It seemed that Izac was suffering in great pain.<br>
Wound caused by evil monsters from [Profound] was not same as normal wounds.<br>
Medical team of Regiment could treat this kind of wound, however, not this time.<br>
Izac kept groaning. Evarist saw yellow liquid coming out with blood from his right eye.<br>
“Need to see a doctor as soon as possible...May be we can find town soon...Let's hope so.”<br>
Evarist encouraged Izac.<br>
“....Ugh...Doctor?...hope?”<br>
Izac took cloth, used as bandage, off from his right eye.<br>
“I...don't like the word Maybe... You know that, right?”<br>
Izac looked Evarist's face.<br>
Evarist lost his word when he saw Izac's right eye.<br>
Infection from evil monster had changed color of Izac's right eye into a gross color and it made Evarist almost to vomit.<br>
|<br>
Izac's right hand slowly grub his right eye.<br>
Izac was screaming hardly, however he did not stop what he was doing.<br>
He pulled out his own eye by himself and threw that away.<br>
“...Well...This is much...better in this way.”<br>
He stood up and he crushed his eye in his underfoot.<br>
Only Evarist could do was just looking at Izac with opened mouth.<br>
|<br>
|<br>
They wondered around the wasteland.<br>
As the time goes by, they got hold of the situation.<br>
News of [Profound] disappearance had reached to small town in frontier.<br>
They knew all of [Profound] were eliminated and all of Regiments had disappeared with [The Eye].<br>
Regiments were now recognized as hero of tragedy.<br>
At this point, Evarist realized the fact which Regiment was abandoned.<br>
Regiments were no longer needed for the world.<br>
Evarist did not feel any anger or sadness.<br>
Members of Regiment were ready to die anytime.<br>
[Property] or [Reputation] did not have any meaning to them.<br>
However instead of being angry or sad, Evarist started to have a strong will.<br>
“I don't want waste any of Regiment's death...”<br>
“If the world does not need us...I'll change the world.”<br>
|<br>
One day, they found huge castle above the horizon.<br>
“We will reach there tomorrow.” Evarist said.<br>
They were at the edge of Granddillenia Empire.<br>
“What you going to do?” Izac asked<br>
“We don't have place to go back.” Evarist responded quickly and continued,<br>
“I heard they are hiring soldiers...with no requirements.”<br>
Empire was expanding their military force.<br>
[Profound] is gone now, so there was no reason to hide in fortified city<br>
“You want come with me, Izac?”<br>
“Yes, sir! I'll be right behind you, General Waltz!”<br>
They both laughed hard.<br>
|<br>
When he lost his home, when he lost Regiment, Izac was always with him.<br>
They were always together to fight against the cruel world.<br>
However now, there is a distance in between them.<br>
Things had changed...and both Evarist and Izac changed.<br>
He might have lost his best partner, but Evarist could not stop.<br>
He knew would lose everything again, if he stops now,<br>

That yellow seed fell on the ground when it became big.<br>
And then, from inside of mysterious seed, living thing called [Ayn] was born.<br>
|<br>
Sky was high, and trees were huge in this forest.<br>
Ayn wanted to stay here long time if she did not have her mission.<br>
However, she had to move on.<br>
Her mission was to get the [orb] back from [Dark Sailors].<br>
She had to go back to her home forest with [orb] as soon as possible.<br>
First of all, she had to get out from this forest and see this world.<br>
She concentrated her ears and nose to search sounds and smells of her surroundings.<br>
Then she noticed some weird feeling in her body.<br>
Her body was covered by fur. She was walking in four legs. Her hands and legs had pad on it.<br>
She was surprised and screamed once,<br>
“Mew!”<br>
Her scream came out as mewing.<br>
|<br>
Even though, she had transformed into animal shape, there was mission which she need to work on.<br>
Her auditory sense and the sense of smell became much lower than before.<br>
She could not use them to search her surroundings anymore.<br>
Only thing she could do is walk.<br>
She did not see any humans in this forest.<br>
Some time she was attacked by other beast.<br>
She continued walking for few days now, but she still could not get out from this forest. It seemed much bigger than she thought.<br>
|<br>
It was night when she woke up. There was bright star shining in the sky.<br>
She meant to take a nap, but it seemed that she had slept much longer than she planned to.<br>
When she tried to stretch, she could not move her body well.<br>
At the first, she thought it was because of her tiredness, and then she noticed that all of furs had disappeared from her body, and her arms and legs were in original form.<br>
“I'm back!”<br>
She could speak this time.<br>
Now she can work on her mission in earnest.<br>
|<br>
She started to search her surroundings again.<br>
There was sound of trees swaying in wind and smell of the ground. Also she heard a long howl of beast looking for food.<br>
Then she noticed some metallic sound from one direction.<br>
She concentrated her senses towards that direction.<br>
And then, she caught speaking voice of human.<br>
“They are humans in this world, for sure” She talked to herself quietly.<br>
“Might be able to find a clue from them.”<br>
When she thought that, forgotten tiredness came back to her and she fell asleep.<br>
|<br>
It was already around the noon when she woke up.<br>
She started run using her [four legs] to the direction which she caught human voice.<br>
Then she noticed something is wrong. Her visual point was in low position.<br>
She had been transformed into animal shape again while she was sleeping.<br>
She had no clue what was happening to her, but she had no time to think about it.<br>
Even though she was very puzzled, she kept running.<br>
|<br>
Suddenly she bumped into something.<br>
She thought it was a tree she bumped into.<br>
However it was not a tree.<br>
It was a leg of gigantic beast with sharp fangs and long horn.<br>
Because she was stunned by seeing such a gigantic beast, she did not notice that she was in shadow.<br>
Maybe she was too small for beast to notice.<br>
It was already too late when she noticed beast's foot was in her overhead.<br>
Huge foot squashed half of her body.<br>
|<br>
Ayn was in violent pain. She could not move at all.<br>
She knew this world will be dangerous. She was ready to face difficult situations.<br>
However, she had never imagined to be transformed into animal shape.<br>
Things that happened to her were beyond her imagination.<br>
She decided to sleep for recovery.<br>
She could not die, yet.<br>
There are her families waiting for the [orb].<br>
While she was thinking of her family, she fell asleep slowly.<br>
|<br>
There was a well-dressed boy walking in forest.<br>
He started to run. It seemed that he found something interesting.<br>
Ayn was lying there.<br>
A Boy poked Ayn by handle of his sword.<br>
Ayn did not have energy to run away or to have conversation with him.<br>
He picked her up and put her into his bag.<br>
“Yes! A new pet!”<br>
He was almost skipping on the way back.<br>

24,146,1,"Year 3378. - The Gateway -",1,"Chaosium. It was created by [Engineers] of ancient time. Old document says it had been used for many things. However, in present, usage of Chaosium was restricted only for military usage by [academy], because running out of Chaosium control caused creation of evil whirlpool [Profound]. Academy formed [Regiment] to eliminate [Profound]; however, it seemed not working as they planned.<br>
Every engineer was aware of this story.<br>
|<br>
In a laboratory in Pandemonium, there were several forbidden researches.<br>
Marguerite followed that regulations just like others did.<br>
However, at some point of her life time, she had to change her mind.<br>
She could not follow to regulations anymore in order to save her child.<br>
Her baby was born with deadly heart disease. She told that her baby will not live long with current medical technology of [engineer]. Great medical technology had been lost for long time. Now people had to live with unstable medical technology.<br>
|<br>
Marguerite could not face the fact to losing her child who just saw the light.<br>
“Why he has to be dead?”<br>
She gave almost her entire life into researches which will make blight future of this world. However, her son will die before he sees that future.<br>
Marguerite could not stand that fact.<br>
She decided to sell her soul to evil.<br>
|<br>
She started to read all kind of documents to search the cure for her son. She knew that she was walking into outside of human territory. However for her son, she did not hesitate.<br>
|<br>
She was frustrated by result of her research. It did not go well as she wanted to.<br>
She was in her laboratory for many days. Besides of her research, she continued analyzing whirlpool [Profound]. Condition of [Profound] was showing on the monitor screen in real-time sent by member of [Regiment]. Her main task in this laboratory was to estimate existence time or risk allowances of [Profound].<br>
[Profound], the evil whirlpool, in the monitor, was rotating with many colors of lights.<br>
[Profound], in shape of whirlpool, strictly it was a [node] to another world.<br>
The true reason why Chaosium went out of control was kept in top secret. However, every [engineer] knows Chaosium had become as gateway to another world.<br>
A hole to the world with different natural law and different history had made on the ground.<br>
Some famous engineer said that<br>
“Chaosium is a substance extracts its energy from probability. And parallel world exists on probability. Chaosium will eventually break a borderline between our world and parallel world.”<br>
As proving that word, Chaosium, cluster of probability, transformed wonderful energy source to disaster of nightmare.<br>
|<br>
One day, Marguerite found an interesting report from one of [Regiment]. Report was mentioning the fact that some [Regiment] who went inside of [Profound] had obtained special perception. It was not difficult for her to imagine those [Regiment] were affected by Chaosium. At this point Marguerite found connection of her research and cure for her son. Maybe it was a stupid idea which her exhausted brain made up. However, that idea was the only light in darkness for her.<br>
|<br>
Marguerite's plan was to make Chaosium out of control on purpose, and put her son under an influence of Chaosium, just as [Regiment] mentioned on the report. She planned to use influence of Chaosium, the cluster of probability, as cure of her son.<br>
She thought evolution of [Regiment] mentioned on the report, was caused by survival instincts which every human have.<br>
Her answer was to make that circumstance artificially.<br>
|<br>
After that, Marguerite started to research on influence of Chaosium towards human body. She read all of the reports from [Regiments], and she studied about direct influence of human and Chaosium from ancient documents.<br>
|<br>
One day, some researcher visited Marguerite's laboratory.<br>
He said he is a man who has not given up researching possibility of Chaosium.<br>
And then he also said, that researchers and engineers will not be able to achieve anything if they follow [academy] blindly. Marguerite knew there were some engineers and researchers do prohibited researches, it was the first time for her to meet with researcher like that.<br>
|<br>
Researcher kept speaking.<br>
“If all of us shared our research data, it will be a help for us to achieve each one's goal.”<br>
His eyes glittered ambitiously.<br>
“Do you want to join us?”<br>
Marguerite responded quickly.<br>
“Let me in.”<br>
She knew that she was at the limit to do all of research herself.<br>
She really needed a help.<br>
“Thank you so much! I knew you'd say that!”<br>
They shook their hands. After shaking their hands, researcher put his hand in his pocket. He pulled out same papers.<br>
“This is copy of document which we call it as [Codex]. This might help your research. Please accept this as gift.”<br>
She looked into it when that researcher left her laboratory.<br>
It was the most illegible document in her life.<br>
|<br>
She started study [Codex]. It was filled with information which she was missing. It was just like she found missing piece of Jigsaw puzzle. Using information and knowledge from her self-research and [Codex], she started to create life saving device of her son.<br>
|<br>
Marguerite had built a huge device in few days without any sleep.<br>
For trial operation, she set Chaosium in the device carefully.<br>
She took a deep breath once, and then she started the device...<br>
It started to make huge noise. However, nothing had happened.<br>
“A failure...huh?”<br>
She whispered, and fell on her backside. Forgotten tiredness came back to her.<br>
It took a while for her to move.<br>
When she stood up to stop the device, she saw a black space coming into existence on top of the device. Then it started to change its shape into whirlpool.<br>
After a while it slowly disappeared, and left a sight of another world.<br>
|<br>
The gateway to another world had opened.<br>

“Wait! Eva! We're told not to go outside the wall”<br>
“It's fine, Izac! Just for a short time!”<br>
“But....”<br>
“Come on...Stop being a good boy.”<br>
Evarist pretended a bad mood. Izac nodded awkwardly.<br>
“...Okay, Eva.”<br>
|<br>
Evarist was son of feudal lord.<br>
Izac was son of servant.<br>
There was difference between their statuses, but they were close friend.<br>
However, Izac had to make sure that Evarist does not get hurt.<br>
Even though Evarist was his closest friend, he was still son of feudal lord.<br>
Izac always worried about Evarist.<br>
And Evarist did not like that attitude of his best friend.<br>
|<br>
They arrived to Evarist's favorite spot where can have a view of whole city.<br>
“I love this view!”<br>
Evarist stretched once and fell down on the grass.<br>
Izac followed Evarist.<br>
They were looking into the sky without saying anything.<br>
It was peaceful time. Izac felt that the time goes by really show.<br>
They kept looking into the sky for a while.<br>
|<br>
However, thunderous roar broke their peaceful time suddenly.<br>
The ground started to shake. Trees on the hill swayed hard like in the strong wind.<br>
It was hard for them to stand up to check their town.<br>
Ground was shaking hardly<br>
They sat down on the ground to wait the ground stop shaking.<br>
“What's going on?”<br>
“I...I don't know, Eva.”<br>
|<br>
The ground stopped to shake after a while.<br>
They stand up and looked into their town.<br>
It was hard for them to see well because cloud of dust was covering a whole city.<br>
They kept staring, and then ruined city started to appear in their sight.<br>
“Mom! Dad!”<br>
As soon as Evarist saw it, he started to run.<br>
Izac was left there for a moment being stunned.<br>
Then he started to run following Evarist.<br>
|<br>
Situation in city was worse than what they saw from on top of the hill.<br>
There were many houses collapsed and remaining houses were almost to collapse.<br>
People were crying and screaming.<br>
They covered their ears and kept running to their house.<br>
|<br>
Around of their house, there was group of people who escaped from that earthquake.<br>
Evarist and Izac pushed their way through the crowd.<br>
...Then they saw.<br>
“...Are you kidding me?”<br>
Izac went down on his knees.<br>
Their house had totally disappeared without leaving any rubble.<br>
Beside of Izac, Evarist was asking people if any of them had seen his parents.<br>
No one had the answer. People were just shaking their head in silent.<br>
|<br>
Someone noticed that black dark thing started to appear where the house was.<br>
It seemed to getting bigger slowly.<br>
People started to gathering around of that black dark thing.<br>
“It's a.... whirlpool.”<br>
When the black dark thing made its shape into whirlpool, strange creatures started to come out from inside of it.<br>
It was human shaped creature with green or blue skin.<br>
It had big eye without the pupil and sharp ear.<br>
Their height was almost same as child, like Izac and Evarist.<br>
They were holding primitive weapons such as club or hatchet.<br>
Even though they were in human shape, they did not exist in this world for sure.<br>
|<br>
When one of creature recognized crowd, it started to walk towards to them.<br>
A little hobbit stopped in front of crowd, and then it looked up face of a man who was in front line.<br>
It seemed that little hobbit was smiling.<br>
One of crowd thought that as a sign of friend ship, and he stepped out from crowd.<br>
He made bright smile and tried to shake hand with that creature.<br>
It was a huge mistake...<br>
At the next moment, crowd saw blood and entrails came out from that man.<br>
Weapon in creature's hand was covered by blood.<br>
People awaken by huge scream.<br>
They started to run away from that creatures and whirlpool.<br>
Some adults picked iron stick from rubble and tried to fight against those creatures.<br>
However, quickness and strength of those creatures was much higher than human.<br>
Some courageous men's brave behavior had just caused their own death.<br>
|<br>
“Come on! Izac! We need to run! Let's go!!!”<br>
In dramatic panic, Evarist took Izac's hand and started to run.<br>
They found house which had not damaged as other houses.<br>
They decided to hide in that house.<br>
“It will be Okay, Izac. Regiment will come and save us.”<br>
Evarist encouraged Izac in whispering voice.<br>
Regiment, a group of heroes fighting against evil whirlpool.<br>
They were only in news or magazines for Evarist and Izac.<br>
However, Regiment was their only hope in this situation.<br>
|<br>
There was only sound of footstep of creature outside of the house.<br>
All of screams and shouts of human had disappeared.<br>
Sound of footstep stopped in front of the house which Evarist and Izac were hiding.<br>
There was no ways to run.<br>
Izac closed his eyes and prayed for their life.<br>
Something opened the door. He felt it was getting closer.<br>
He heard its breath right beside of him.<br>
Lukewarm liquid covered Izac after awful sound of slaying flesh.<br>
<No! Eva!!!><br>
Izac screamed in his head.<br>
<Now it's my turn><br>
He started to shiver.<br>
|<br>
“Are you alright, kid?”<br>
It was human voice.<br>
When Izac opened his eyes, he found corpse of evil hobbit.<br>
Evarist was still alive.<br>
He tried to answer man's question, but he could not speak any word.<br>
Instead of speaking, he shook his head up and down<br>
“Where is your Family?” A man asked again.<br>
Izac shook his head to right and left, this time.<br>
“...Sorry to hear that...Come with me. It's dangerous to stay here.”<br>
A man helped Izac to stand up.<br>
“...Yes”<br>
That was the only word Izac could say.<br>
|<br>
Through window in flying ship, Izac was looking down his home town Forest Hill.<br>
It was a beautiful city just a while ago.<br>
However now, he could not find any houses or shops.<br>
Nothing was remained there, except evil whirlpool.<br>
Izac lost his home...He lost the place to go back.<br>
|<br>
“What are we going to do with these kids, Milian?”<br>
One of Regiments asked to Milian.<br>
Those two kids were sleeping deeply.<br>
“Maybe send to refugee champ?...Hmm, but it's going to be tough for little kid like them.”<br>
Milian thought for a moment, and said,<br>
“Or maybe they can join Regiment...Like you did, Bernhard.”<br>
A man called Bernhard, who saved Izac and Evarist, opened his eyes and said,<br>
“It's up to them...”<br>

It was perfect victory.<br>
Granddillenia force had much bigger force than Lonsbrough army.<br>
However Lonsbrough army kept defending invasion of Granddillenia force.<br>
|<br>
It had been a few month since Grunwald arrived to battle field, where was on the border line of Lubiana.<br>
Grunwald and his force had defeated many platoons of Granddillenia force.<br>
However, Granddillenia Empire kept attacking.<br>
It seemed that they did not have any will to make peace conference.<br>
As the matter of the fact, Both Lonsbrough and Lubiana did not have big enough army to defeat Granddillenia force completely.<br>
Their force was becoming slowly but surely exhausted in each day.<br>

Adjutant persuaded Grunwald.<br>
“.........”<br>
Grunwald ignored him and kept taking care of his arms.<br>
They had exchanged this kind of conversation for many times.<br>
“Please be in the camp, and just to give an order! Supreme commander would never be in front line! Please listen to me, Commander!”<br>
Grunwald had the same advice for many times, but he had never changed his mind.<br>
“My sword wants to taste blood...Yes, blood...It wants to suck lots of blood.”<br>
Grunwald whispered while he was checking his sword.<br>
Adjutant became scared when he heard Grunwald's whisper.<br>
Suddenly Grunwald raised his face and asked,<br>
“Are we receiving enough supplies from main land?”<br>
Adjutant was surprised first and then when he realized the true meaning of that question, he started to shiver.<br>
“Yes, commander. No there were not enough supplies sent in last shipment, sir.”<br>
As adjutant said, army in front line had not received enough supplies from main land. Even the amount of supplies was kept decreasing.<br>
Even though adjutant did not report that fact, Grunwald had noticed it by himself.<br>
“I'm a good target in battle field...It will prevent consumption of soldiers if I stand there, don't you think?”<br>
Grunwald asked to adjutant.<br>
“Yes, commander. However...”<br>
Grunwald interrupted adjutant, saying,<br>
“Or you want your dead cut off by neglecting your report duties?”<br>

“Yeah! Our prince had defeated all most half of Granddillenia force by himself!”<br>
“Hey, that is way too much.”<br>

“I was almost killed myself when I heard that weird prince will came back here...”<br>
“Thank god, huh?”<br>
“I'll thank our prince if our tax goes down by winning this war.”<br>
“Ha-ha. No doubt about that!”<br>

People in capital city were talking about their prince proudly.<br>
They all had cheerful look even in wartime.<br>
However, in the castle of Lonsbrough, it was totally opposite.<br>
Unlike citizens in capital city, all retainers in castle had gloomy face.<br>
“Look at this...”<br>
He threw bunch of news papers on the table.<br>
“Now our prince became a hero of Lonsbrough.”<br>
Every single news papers were praising Grunwald.<br>
Obviously, their face was not pleasing it.<br>
“Why we didn't send enough supplies? Wasn't it to make that weird prince lose?”<br>
“Our plan will be over, if prince makes a triumphant return.”<br>
“Not only plan...we will be over...or even our life will be...”<br>
“It's not going well as you said, Sir. Gaius! How would you manage this situation!!!”<br>
Everyone in the room looked at Gaius's face.<br>
He was the one who made this plan.<br>
He wanted to eliminate prince from all of political activities.<br>
Gaius opened his mouth and spoke with philosophy.<br>
“I think prince understands his situation...He will behave as we wished.”<br>

Someone was calling him.<br>
However Grunwald kept swinging his sword.<br>
He stabbed soldier's chest and belly.<br>
Then cut soldier's arms and legs off.<br>
And then, he crushed soldier's head.<br>
As bloodthirsty beast, Grunwald kept destroying soldier's body.<br>
“Commander!”<br>
Grunwald did not respond to a call.<br>
He was intoxicated by sound of crashing human.<br>
He also loved the feeling of slaying human body.<br>
It was a great moment for him to feel death.<br>
Also it was a moment when he was able to release his mind.<br>
|<br>
“Commander!!!”<br>
Grunwald stopped crushing body after third call.<br>
It was a platoon leader who was calling him.<br>
“I do not see any enemies around here, commander, I suggest go back to the camp.”<br>
“....Let's go, then”<br>
He rode on to his horse.<br>

Even though Grunwald was Supreme Commander, his war effort was much higher than anyone else.<br>
However, his mind was still thirsting for more blood.<br>

Little pickpocket boy did not run away in this chance.<br>
Some kind of interest was showing on is face.<br>
“Is this kid got nerves of steel? Or he is just a blockhead?”<br>
Abel thought that in his mind.<br>
|<br>
“Kill him!”<br>
Leader of punks shouted.<br>
Other two jumped on Abel.<br>
“Well, well...Did I make you guys that mad?”<br>
Abel was investigating their skills while he was dogging their swords.<br>
Quick movements with well trained combinations...<br>
“Not too bad.”<br>
It was his evaluation.<br>
|<br>
“Stop moving, you bastard!”<br>
“That's it! Hey! Let's make this over!”<br>
Punks make a sign with their eyes, and then attacked Abel at the same time.<br>
It was double attacks by different sides.<br>
Punk leader smiled with confident of victory.<br>
He saw many enemies had been slayed by that attack.<br>
It would put an end to Abel's life, if he was a normal person.<br>
However, they were facing against remain of Regiment.<br>
Two shouts echoed in alley after metallic sound.<br>
What Abel did was to just swing his sword once, and it was all over.<br>
After knocking down two punks, Abel got quickly close to punk leader, and said.<br>
“Hey, you want try some of this?”<br>
Abel put his large sword to leader's throat.<br>
“...Crap! Let's go! Guys! Wake up!”<br>
Leader kicked two punks to wake them up, and ran away.<br>
|<br>
“Are you alright, kid? Take this as lesson. Try to change your job.”<br>
Abel freed little pickpockets from net.<br>
Little boy stood up by himself, and spoke to Abel while dusting his cloth.<br>
“I don't remember saying “help me...” Mr.”<br>
He looked up Abel's face like nothing had happened<br>
“...Mr.?...Hey! I'm not that old!”<br>
Abel corrected boy's word and shrugged his shoulders.<br>
“Do you know how to say “Thank You” ?”<br>
Boy was still dusting his cloth and he was not listening to Abel at all.<br>
“...Silly kid!... Anyways, where is my wallet.”<br>
Abel received his wallet and tapped it once and twice, to check inside.<br>
“Guess you didn't take money out, huh? Well, good bye then. Have a nice day! Watch out for those punks.”<br>
Boy was standing there looking at Abel.<br>
When Abel saw that figure, he changed his mind.<br>
“I'm thinking to go eat something, be my company.”<br>
This little boy needed to be pickpockets to survive in this slum.<br>
Abel sympathized to this little boy........just a little bit.<br>
|<br>
They moved to the bar where Abel supposed to meet Leon.<br>
Abel ordered alcohol and handed menu to little boy.<br>
“Eat whatever you want, kid.”<br>
Everyone in the bar was looking at them.<br>
Abel felt that it was not because of child was in the bar.<br>
He found out why everyone was looking at them when he went to get his alcohol to the counter.<br>
Bartender spoke under his breath with grimace face.<br>
“Yo, Brother. Watch out for that kid...He is the worst kid in slum. Even police can't handle him.”<br>
“What? He is the worst one? You're kidding, right?”<br>
Abel laughed and continued,<br>
“Well... Even so, no one can handle my sword around here. Punks, gangs, no problem.”<br>
After saying that to bartender, Abel went back to his table with handful alcohols.<br>
|<br>
After a while of eating and drinking, Abel put his face close to boy and asked,<br>
“Hey kid...Heard you have some fellows in slum, is that true?”<br>
Boy leaned back and said,<br>
“ ... My name is not [kid] and you stink.”<br>
“Huh?”<br>
“I name is Jead. Stop calling me [Hey kid].”<br>
Little boy, Jead showed his pride. Abel smiled and said,<br>
“Oops. It's my bad, sorry. My name is Abel. Nice to meet you, Jead.”<br>
“I didn't ask your name, Mr.”<br>
This cocky little boy did not change the way to call Abel.<br>
“...Don't call me Mr...Anyhow, I'll ask you again Jead. Do you have fellows in slum?”<br>
Jead nodded with lots of food in his mouth.<br>
“Hmm...you have fellows there huh...”<br>
Abel thought for a moment and asked to Jead,<br>
“I have one job for you...You want to take it?”<br>
“...?...?”<br>
Jead said something but Abel could not understand what he said.<br>
But it was for sure that Jead was interested to Abel's job, so he started to explain.<br>
“Finish eating first...I'm looking for someone. He's the one who called me here but never shows up.”<br>
Abel told how Leon's looks.<br>
“I want you to ask your fellows if anyone had seen him or not...I'd say for about a week.”<br>
And then he took some money out from his wallet.<br>
“This will be your daily payment....”<br>
“I'll take it”<br>
As soon as Abel put money on the table, Jead took it right away and put it in his pocket.<br>
“Hey! That wasn't advance payment...Oh well. You need to report once a day, in here at the same time. Oh and I'll buy you some food too.”<br>
|<br>
Next day in the bar.<br>
“How was it?”<br>
Abel asked to Jead.<br>
On the table, there were great amount of food which Jead ordered.<br>
Everyone seemed to be surprised by its amount.<br>
“No one in east slum had seen such a guy.”<br>
Jead reported his effort.<br>
“Oh...Okay.”<br>
“Maybe dead already?”<br>
Jead mentioned the point which Abel did not try to imagine.<br>
“Nah...I'm not worried about that. He's kind of a guy who won't get killed that easy.”<br>
Abel responded to Jead with a wry smile.<br>
He knew that Leon is smart and tough.<br>
Why a guy like that needed Abel's help?<br>
Why Leon never shows up?<br>
There were a lot of question marks in Abel's head.<br>
|<br>
It had been a week since Abel hired Jead.<br>
He was receiving last report from Jead in the bar.<br>
“Negative, huh?...Well, thanks Jead.”<br>
Abel threw his wallet to Jead.<br>
“You'll be able to eat for a while. Find [normal job] during that time.”<br>
There was more money than Abel offered in that wallet.<br>
“This is more than you said.”<br>
“Just take it.”<br>
Abel tapped Jead's head couple of times and left the bar.<br>
|<br>
There was no sign of Leon had been in Meriguadia.<br>
Also he did not show up during last week.<br>
Even though, Leon was kind of guy who never shows up on time, I had never been this late.<br>
Like Abel told Jead, he did not worry about Leon's life.<br>
...However there was possibility which Leon is having some kind of trouble.<br>
Abel decided to leave Meriguadia to search for his old friend.<br>

28,58,1,"Year 3394. - Laughter -",1,"There was a dead body, with no head, lying in front of Kronig.<br>
In awful smell of blood, he was about to throw up.<br>
He closed his eyes and covered his mouth with hand.<br>
<Now, your imaginary world came closer><br>
He heard voice from corner of his room.<br>
He was not sure that he actually [heard] that voice or not.<br>
Also he was not sure [that thing] was actually existing or not.<br>
He was not able to judge if [that thing] was in real or in his imagination.<br>
--That is why he name it as [Phantom Beast].<br>
|<br>
“What is this? What the heck is [imaginary world]? You thought I wanted murder someone? STOP JORKING! I never wished someone's death!”<br>
Kronig shouted.<br>
<Well...As you said, you do not wish indiscriminate murder...yet><br>
It laughed.<br>
“Well, if so, WHAT THE HECK is this dead body? Where did you bring this from? You are the one wanted to kill someone!!!”<br>
It narrowed its three eyes. Seemed it was smiling.<br>
<[Someone] you said? Watch carefully Kronig. This is what you wished.><br>
Dead body was wearing a coat.<br>
His thinking froze when he recognized that.<br>
That dead body was wearing a coat which is familiar to him.<br>
|<br>
......I know this coat.<br>
|<br>
Kronig started to confuse.<br>
Then he imagined the worst situation.<br>
To deny a bad imagination, he started to find identification of this dead body.<br>
When he put his hand to pocket, he felt some card inside of pocket.<br>
He took it out. It was ID card of [Technocrat].<br>
It had a name which he never wanted to see in this situation.<br>
He went down on his knees.<br>
<I just did as you wished. You wanted to get rid of him from your life, right? ><br>
It laughed again and continued.<br>
<I'm waiting for your gratitude, Kronig><br>
“....no....no way”<br>
Kronig shook his head.<br>
“I'd never......Never wanted his death!!!”<br>
In front of father Iasi's dead body, Kronig shouted with anger.<br>
|<br>
<Nah...You wanted his death. You wanted father, who leaves his son alone, out of this world.><br>
Kronig stared at it.<br>
<Hey, don't look at me like that. I just pulled out your true wish from deep inside of you.><br>
Kronig could not say anything.<br>
<I grant you wish...And the world will change as you wished. Remember, your [imaginary world] is also my [imaginary world]><br>
And then, it vanished from his sight.<br>
|<br>
He thought he will be crying for his father's death.<br>
However, he did not have any tears in his eyes.<br>
He thought himself as a cold blooded fool.<br>
|<br>
Or maybe whatever [it] said was true......<br>
|<br>
|<br>
It was a fine flight.<br>
Flying ship will land to Lonsbrough within an hour.<br>
“We are almost there, Mr. Iosif.”<br>
Young officer spoke to Iosif.<br>
“....What?....Ah Okay.”<br>
Iosif kept looking outside and asked to officer,<br>
“Is it safe to fly around his area?”<br>
Talkative officer responded Iosif's question right away.<br>
“Much safer now. It used to be a life risking flight, though.”<br>
Officer's voice had some kind of nostalgia.<br>
All of [Profound] had been eliminated.<br>
Era called as [Darkness Age] had finished now.<br>
They kept talking.<br>
“Chaosium had caused everything huh?”<br>
“Indeed...but this flying ship can't fly without Chaosium...Good and bad for everything, I think.”<br>
“Good and bad, huh?...[Darkness Age] was caused by its negative side.”<br>
“But our Regiments put the end to [Darkness Age]. This is our victory, don't you think so, Mr.Iosif?”<br>
“...Victory...maybe we can say that.”<br>
A pilot called officer through income.<br>
“Excuse me Mr. Iosif. I need to go.”<br>
|<br>
That young officer said victory.<br>
However, Iosif believed that there is no victory or goal for [Technocrat].<br>
They need to keep progressing.<br>
To keep his research progressing, Iosif gave all of his life.<br>
There were no questions or doubts in his head.<br>
His own son, Kronig's trouble was pushed aside in his head already.<br>
|<br>
When he started to think about his work, his sight suddenly became in dark.<br>
Before he switches his mind, he heard the voice.<br>
<...You really don't care about him, huh?<br>
Evil three eyes appeared in front of Iosif.<br>
Something was coming out from darkness.<br>
Before Iosif say anything, huge jaw from darkness covered his sight.<br>
It was the last thing he saw at the end of his life.<br>
<Well...as a faithful servant, I need to report my effort to my [master]...huh?><br>
It laughed once and disappeared.<br>
|<br>
When officer came back to Iosif's sheet, it was covered by blood.<br>
Young officer screamed when he saw a thing on the sheet.<br>
Like someone's lost property, Iosif's head was on his sheet.<br>

29,68,1,"Year 3393. - The Shimmer -",1,"Jead's revenge for his guild made him famous among gangs in slum.<br>
Many gang families had scouted him to obtain remained territories of Davit family.<br>
|<br>
As usual, Jead had visitor in his room.<br>
“You're the one who killed all of David family, right?”<br>
Some gang asked him.<br>
“I didn't know you were that tough, you want join our family?”<br>
Jead had same kinds of offer so many times since that day.<br>
Also his answer was always the same.<br>
“...Get off”<br>
Without showing any expressions, he whispered to gang.<br>
Gang put his smile away.<br>
“Well...Then I have to kill you now”<br>
As other gangs, he decided to eliminate Jead for their own safety.<br>
“I'm sorry Jead...You are just too dangerous for us.”<br>
Gang pulled out his knife.<br>
Jead was just watching it with empty eyes.<br>
His miserable life had taken all of his emotions away.<br>
|<br>
Jead just wanted to be alone.<br>
However so many people visited him day after day.<br>
Gangs, thieves, and mercenaries...Many kinds of people had offered him to join them.<br>
Jead denied them all.<br>
Most of them drew their sword to Jead; however, all of them were killed by him.<br>
He kept denying, and kept killing.<br>
That fact made Jead even more famous.<br>
|<br>
People started to gathering around Jead.<br>
Jead had become the icon of weak people in slum.<br>
He did not attempt to rule slum area by using his mysterious power.<br>
And his behavior made him charismatic unintentionally.<br>
Some of them called their group as Jead Family and started to call Jead as [The King of Slum].<br>
His family was getting bigger and bigger in each day.<br>
However, Jead was just looking at people, who call him as [King], in empty eyes.<br>
|<br>
One day Jead was in the silent world.<br>
He knew it was in his dream.<br>
He was in the center of battle field.<br>
One army had uniform and same type of weapons in their hand.<br>
Other army looked like some kind of rebel army.<br>
War situation looked even, but it seemed that rebel army had higher moral.<br>
None of soldiers recognized Jead.<br>
Swords and bullets were slipping through Jead's body.<br>
He recognized flags of both armies.<br>
Both flags were familiar to him, but he could not remember where he saw it.<br>
He kept wondering around in the battle field watching soldier's death.<br>
|<br>
<..........you...><br>
Jead heard the voice in the silent world.<br>
It was a weak voice.<br>
<I....... you><br>
He concentrated his ears to catch that voice.<br>
<I..........for........time><br>
Again he heard the same voice.<br>
This way?<br>
He meant to speak but his voice had disappeared in this silent world.<br>
He started to walk towards that voice.<br>
<....found...you><br>
Voice started to hear clearly as he got closer.<br>
However, he still could not find who was speaking to him.<br>
He was still in the silent world, but he did not care about it.<br>
Only he cared about that voice.<br>
|<br>
The voice was from shimmer.<br>
It was slowly approaching to him.<br>
<You are the one we were looking for...><br>
It had a woman voice.<br>
<The one closest to Super Note><br>
Jead noticed that shimmer was in human shape.<br>
<We never imagined you would be hiding in here...><br>
When it reached to Jead, it started to enfold him.<br>
Then he started to have strong ear noises. He shook his head to get rid of it.<br>
It did not work.<br>
Then that ear noises changed into terrible headache.<br>
“......!!!”<br>
|<br>
Jead jumped off from his bed and looked around to check his surroundings.<br>
He was in his room...Nothing was wrong in there.<br>
However, he still had weird feeling of his dream.<br>
For a while, he could not tell if he is in real life or still in that dream.<br>
He was thinking deeply so he could not notice that some emotions had come back to his empty eyes.<br>

30,98,1,"Year 3393. - My Sweet Home -",1,"There were only two men in the room of cheap hotel.<br>
“What's up, Yant. Long time no see.”<br>
Blaise talked to a man lying on the bed.<br>
Man called Yant slowly raised his head and looked at Blaise.<br>
“Blaise?...You still alive...huh?”<br>
Blaise could easily tell that Yant is not going to live long by his weak voice and his pale complexion.<br>
“Invitation to class reunion, I guess...Sorry, I can't go....As you see...It's hard for me to breathing, now.”<br>
“..........”<br>
Blaise put his hand on his sword without saying anything.<br>
Yant took a deep breath and slowly stood up. And he said,<br>
“I know you don't like this kind of jokes...I know what you been doing...”<br>
He smiled slightly and pointed outside.<br>
“Let's change place...Don't want to make this room dirty.”<br>
After he finished preparing, he took a bag.<br>
“Follow me...”<br>
|<br>
Yant's steps were slow like an old man.<br>
Blaise thought that he was trying to delay his last moment.<br>
He could just slay him now, however, he chose not to sneak attack his old fellow.<br>
Suitable death to remain of Regiment...It was his way to show his respect.<br>
He followed Yant in silence.<br>
|<br>
It was almost twilight when they arrived to quiet river beach.<br>
“Here should be fine.”<br>
Yant opened his bag and took out his [Ceptor].<br>
Blaise was carefully watching Yant's action, but it was needless fear.<br>
Yant threw his [Ceptor] to Blaise and sat down on the rock.<br>
“That's my Ceptor... Dispose it properly...Oh, by the way...”<br>
Yant looked into Blaise's eyes and continued.<br>
“......How many Regiments you've killed?”<br>
Blaise could not answer his question.<br>
He was not sure if Yant was accusing him as a traitor or not.<br>
“I've met Inquisitor who used be Regiment...Just like you, Blaise.”<br>
Yant was closed his eyes.<br>
“......You are not the only one.”<br>
Blaise face became clouded for a moment.<br>
“Be prepared for the worst.....Blaise.”<br>
Blaise knew that he cannot trust [engineers] from long time ago.<br>
He was following them just for his sister.<br>
“Do you have anything else to say?”<br>
Blaise asked without any expressions.<br>
“Nope...Do it.”<br>
|<br>
Blaise swung his sword.<br>
Yant's head went into river first, and then his body went in.<br>
Color of river changed into deep red.<br>
While Blaise was seeing it, he whispered,<br>
“Be prepared for the worst...huh?”<br>
He repeated Yant's word for many times on the way back.<br>
|<br>
“Really?”<br>
Melia shouted with great joy.<br>
“Yes. But it's only for a night. If you feel sick you have to come back here as soon as possible. Okay?”<br>
Doctor gave temporary discharge from hospital to Melia<br>
Blaise was also happy to see his sister smiling with great joy.<br>
|<br>
On the day of temporary discharge, Blaise took little flying ship called as [clipper] to her hospital.<br>
Principally, it was prohibited for private usage; however, it will not be a big problem if he just flies closely around Pandemonium.<br>
He had explained his sister that Pandemonium is flying city.<br>
However she did not have an opportunity to actually see it.<br>
Blaise was not sure when next temporary discharge will be, so he wanted to entertain his sister as many as he can in this time.<br>
|<br>
His sister was very surprised when she saw a flying ship.<br>
“...This time, we did not see it...Please don't do this again.”<br>
Doctor warned Blaise.<br>
“I heard you, Doctor.”<br>
Blaise and Melia waved their hand at doctors, and then flew away from hospital.<br>
|<br>
“Wow! It's really flying!”<br>
Melia seemed that she was really enjoying this sightseeing flight.<br>
When Blaise tried say it is about the time to go back, he heard her whisper.<br>
“I wish we could fly back to our old house...”<br>
He lost his words and started to think.<br>
It is totally out of law.<br>
Also their old house was in far away from here.<br>
It was hard for him to do that if he thought about condition of his sister, and their future.<br>
However, words which came out from his mouth was,<br>
“We need to come back right away if you feel sick, okay?”<br>
“Thank you! Blaise!”<br>
To keep Melia smiling, Blaise decided to break the law.<br>
|<br>
Melia started cook dinner as soon as they arrived to their old house.<br>
She was cooking with great concentration.<br>
After a while there was dinner on the table.<br>
She was almost staring at his brother when he had his first bite.<br>
“How is it?”<br>
Melia asked timidly.<br>
“This is great...you're better than mom.”<br>
Blaise said to Melia and smiled.<br>
|<br>
In midnight, Blaise went outside.<br>
Melia was already sleeping in her room.<br>
Cold night breeze made him calm down.<br>
He decided to walk around his house to enjoy nostalgic view.<br>
Old memories of his childhood came back in his head.<br>
Melia was always smiling in those memories.<br>
Then he looked up the sky, thinking a way to protect his sister.<br>
“I'll protect you Melia...”<br>
Blaise whispered.<br>
|<br>
In the next morning, Blaise called his sister from downstairs.<br>
“Melia, we're going to leave here around the noon.”<br>
They had to go back to Pandemonium today.<br>
There was no replay from little sister.<br>
Blaise went to upstairs to check her condition.<br>
She was crying on her bed.<br>
“I want to be here...I'm fine....I'm not sick anymore...”<br>
Blaise thought that it was a huge mistake to bring her here<br>
“Just in case, Malia. Let's go back once. We can come back here later.”<br>
“I'm fine......I'm fine.......Don't want to go back there....”<br>
Blaise could not see her agonized look anymore, so he said,<br>
“...Okay...Just a couple more days...That's it, Okay?”<br>
Melia hugged Blaise tightly.<br>

“Hmm...Is that so?”<br>
“Should we send Max to eliminate him?”<br>
“No, please do not send Max...We still need him.”<br>
“What should we do?”<br>

Doctor told Sheri.<br>
Sheri hung her head.<br>
“Come on...He is your owner, right?”<br>
Doctor said it when he saw her depression.<br>
Sheri was in this laboratory for repairmen and checkups.<br>
Even though she knew this peace full days will end someday, her shock was bigger than as she imagined.<br>
“Well, You tend have a tendency to expressing your emotion, little too much, Sheri.”<br>
Unlike to his word, he looked very happy to see Sheri's human like expressions.<br>
Doctor tapped Sheri's shoulder and said,<br>
“I guess you really liked it to be here. I'll ask Mr. Giblyn to send you here regularly for check-ups.”<br>
“Thank you! Doctor!”<br>
Sheri bowed to Doctor and stood up from chair with delight smile.<br>
When she tried to turn around, he tripped on something around her foot.<br>
It was Rob.<br>
She could not notice Rob was there because she was too excited.<br>
As apology of kicking him, she started to pat him gently.<br>
Doctor was looking at it pleasantly and he spoke to Sheri,<br>
“Do you want take him with you?”<br>
Sheri looked up Doctor while she was patting Rob, and asked,<br>
“Am I able to?”<br>
She meant to speak in calm; however, she could not hide her excitement<br>
Doctor smiled once and said,<br>
“You tamed him very well...He will start to bark everyone again if he does not stay with you.”<br>
Just like Rob understood Doctor's word, he started to running around Sheri with waving tail.<br>
|<br>
On the day of Sheri's shipment, she asked Doctor about her concern.<br>
“...Excuse me, Doctor...Am I have to be in that box?”<br>
Even though Sheri knew that she was not a human, she was not pleased to be treated as other [dolls] in this laboratory.<br>
“Of cause. Much safer and easier that way. I need to send you back as soon as possible. Mr. Giblyn is waiting for you.”<br>
No, that is not what I meant.<br>
She tried to complain but she could not come up with good excuses.<br>
“Well, Get in! Get in!”<br>
Doctor took Sheri's silent as an acceptance, he urged Sheri to get in the box.<br>
Sheri gave up complaining, and went into box reluctantly.<br>
Before she goes inside completely, she looked at Doctor with a rueful look.<br>
“I know you are sad Sheri...You will be back here. I wish you have a nice trip...”<br>
Doctor misunderstand Sheri again, and put her into sleep mode, then closed the box.<br>
Just before Sheri loses her consciousness, she found Donita's face in her sight.<br>
Somehow Donita looked very happy.<br>
|<br>
Continuing sound of banging wood woke her up.<br>
When Sheri opened her eyes, she was in the dark.<br>
She opened the box and got out from the box.<br>
It was in front of her master's house.<br>
She felt something weird when she saw the house because it had the gate wide open.<br>
The door was not locked either. She called Rob and held him in her arms.<br>
Then she stepped into the house with caution.<br>
There was no one inside of the house.<br>
“Maybe they are all gone for their mission”<br>
At the first, Sheri thought that.<br>
However, she denied her guess right away.<br>
It did not explain the reason of house had been unlocked.<br>
She searched all of the rooms in the house, but she could not find anyone.<br>
|<br>
“Master. This is Sheri. I am back now.”<br>
She knocked the door just in case.<br>
Master's room was the last room to check.<br>
No replay from the room.<br>
Sheri opened the door. It was not locked as other rooms.<br>
Cold winter breeze blew against Sheri when she opened the door.<br>
Window was wide open.<br>
She saw curtain fluttering in the wind.<br>
Then she found her master on his bed.<br>
A large sword had penetrated through his body and also his bed to the floor.<br>
White sheet was dyed into deep red by master's blood.<br>
Rotten body was showing evidence of that he did not get killed in a day or two.<br>
|<br>
A man who made Sheri into assassin is dead now.<br>
Of cause Sheri was shocked by master's death.<br>
However, on the other hand, she was also happy about it.<br>
Although Doctor said she can go back to her mission no problem, she was not sure if she can still assassinate target as before.<br>
Also somewhere in her mind, she did not want to be on a mission again.<br>
Assassination had become a hard task for her.<br>
|<br>
This unexpected freedom made Sheri puzzled.<br>
It was hard for her to make a decision by herself.<br>
In her conclusion, she decided to observe master's dead body for a while.<br>
She wanted to see figure of after death.<br>
After understanding herself, she became more curious about death.<br>
Other than playing with Rob, she spent lots of time in master's room.<br>
Corruption of master's body was dragging Sheri's attention.<br>
She could not tell if she was doing this as revenge or as mourning<br>

Many days had passed.<br>
Sheri found Rob lying on the floor right beside of her bed when she woke up.<br>
She called his name, but he did not move at all.<br>
She jumped off from bed because she felt something is wrong with Rob<br>
Rob did not move even after Sheri held him in her arms.<br>
Sheri did not think that Rob is dead because she knew Rob was same kind as Sheri.<br>
However, it was for sure Rob need to be repaired by Doctor.<br>
“...Need to find him.”<br>
She whispered, and started to prepare for her journey.<br>
Even though, she did not know where the laboratory was, she needed to find out for Rob.<br>
She put Rob inside of her bag, and ran out from the house.<br>

32,48,1,"Year 3394. - A Train -",1,"Leon was on a train called [Bullet Express].<br>
It was quickly restored after disappearance of [Profound].<br>
Its railroad was connected to main cities as spider net.<br>
Time was starting to move again, so as people.<br>
|<br>
“Phew...Finally I can get some rest!”<br>
Leon sat down on his sheet and talked to himself.<br>
[The Eye] was located in wasteland, south of province called Saran.<br>
It was long travel for him.<br>
He wanted to recover his physical strength in this train.<br>
Even though his wounds were treated by medical officer in prison of Aiakos, his strength had not come back, yet.<br>
To restore his energy, Leon decided to sleep all the way to the last station. .<br>
He was thinking about his [nice] friend who brought him into this crappy situation while he was trying to sleep.<br>
He kept thinking for the reason why Archibald screwed him up, but he could not understand why Archibald did such a thing to him.<br>
He stopped thinking about Archibald. He did not want to waste his sleeping time by thinking about him anymore.<br>
|<br>
Leon heard some metallic sound in half asleep.<br>
That sound was totally different from vibrating sound of train.<br>
He saw a weird man sitting in front of him when he opened his eyes.<br>
A weird spoke in gloomy voice.<br>
“Did I wake you up? Sorry.”<br>
He was wearing a black coat and his face was hidden by hood.<br>
He dressed totally different from other passengers.<br>
A weird man kept moving his artificial hand repeatedly and kept talking to Leon.<br>
“I don't like to be on the ground, you know? Humidity and smell of air makes me sick.”<br>
Leon stared at him and replayed to a man in his way,<br>
“What the heck you want? You're not here to talk to me, right?”<br>
“Yes, actually I'm here to talk with you.” A man said to Leon.<br>
His gloomy voice gave Leon an unpleasant feeling.<br>
Also Leon sensed some kind of trouble from the way weird man talks.<br>
“Well than, hello, nice to see you, and good-bye!”<br>
Leon stood up from his sheet and started to leave.<br>
“Come on...Please allow me to introduce myself...My name is......”<br>
As soon weird man said that, Leon quickly drew his revolver out of his gun holder and put a bullet right into his head.<br>
“I said good-bye, right? ”<br>
Leon grub his baggage and jumped over his sheet to take a distance from weird man<br>
That type of guy always brings some trouble.<br>
His experience had told him that.<br>
When Leon turned around to check, weird man was standing up slowly.<br>
And then he dropped a bullet from his hand.<br>
|<br>
Leon was looking at rolling bullet on the floor.<br>
“I'm sick of this kind of crap!”<br>
He shouted once and then moved to next car.<br>
Then he saw that dead bodies of all of passengers in that car.<br>
“Ugh...crap...What a psycho.”<br>
All of their body was ripped into half.<br>
Leon could easily guess who made this bloody mess.<br>
Floor was slushy by blood and wall was painted deep red.<br>
It was a horrible sight but Leon did not have enough time to sympathize with all of these poor passengers.<br>
He was feeling that weird man is getting closer to.<br>
While he was checking number of bullets, he started to think the way to eliminate that weird man.<br>
He was not sure how well he can fight with his exhausted body, so he had to think more carefully than usually he does.<br>
|<br>
Leon pushed dead bodies aside and moved to last car of this train.<br>
Weird man was chasing after Leon slowly.<br>
When weird man reached to the last car, he spoke to Leon.<br>
“What a cheap shot...I'd never imagined Regiment will fight like that.”<br>
“Shut up, you psycho head.”<br>
Leon shouted to weird man with all of his hate.<br>
Even though he was strongly denied by Leon, he was still trying to talk to Leon.<br>
“Please let's have a talk...It's more constructive in that way. Stop being as savage.”<br>
“...I had enough of your crap Mr. Psycho”<br>
Leon kicked the door open and went outside of train.<br>
He felt pain in his leg when he was thinking to jump off from train.<br>
Then something dragged him towards the door.<br>
“...Hmm I guess it was impossible to talk with savages.”<br>
Weird man whispered. He was grabbing metallic wires in his artificial hand.<br>
Leon noticed that his leg was caught by that wire.<br>
He was dragging with horrifying strength.<br>
“Do you have any idea what you are carrying?”<br>
Weird man asked Leon.<br>
Leon did not respond to that question. He was trying to cut wires using his knife.<br>
“You can't cut it, Leon...Those wires are made by monomolecular fibers...Now please listen to me.”<br>
“Monomo...what? Speak human language!”<br>
Leon gave up understanding what weird man said and pointed his gun to weird man.<br>
He emptied magazine of his revolver in a moment.<br>
All of bullet hit weird man's artificial hand and destroyed it.<br>
After releasing himself from wire, he quickly got outside and climbed up to the roof.<br>
Then he started to move towards the first car of train.<br>
Weird man came up on the roof a while later.<br>
His artificial hand was completely broken but he still had his other hand.<br>
“Did not know that you're that obstinate person”<br>
Weird man swung his arm while he was saying that.<br>
Leon's neck was coiled around with thin wire.<br>
Weird man's action was much quicker than Leon thought.<br>
“Crap!!!”<br>
Leon shouted shortly.<br>
“I got you, Leon...Now listen to me...”<br>
Without loosen any strength, weird man started to talk.<br>
“The device you are carrying will bring back chaos to this world, just as [Profound] did....<br>
I don't really care about under world, however, the result of using that device will be very...<br>
Hmm, how should I say?.....Yes, very inconvenience for us...<br>
We are not enemy Leon. We need that device and you....<br>
Come with me Leon.......Or else...”<br>
|<br>
|<br>
Weird man put more strength to his arm.<br>
Leon writhed even more.<br>
“Your head will say good bye to your body...You have no choice Leon. Come with me...Or you die...”<br>
Leon put his hands up in the air to surrender.<br>
Weird man loosed wires as soon as Leon showed his obedient attitude, and said<br>
“Now you're good boy Leon...I like good boy”<br>
Leon coughed couple of times and spoke to weird man.<br>
“...Cough, cough....I lost, huh?...Oh, by the way, did I ask your name?”<br>
Leon's voice became husky after being choked by wire.<br>
“Oh well, Now you talk like civilized person...My name is Salgado.”<br>
Weird man, Salgado, responded to Leon while he was checking his broken artificial hand.<br>
“Hey...nice to meet you Salgado...Here is my baggage...TAKE IT!!!!”<br>
Leon threw his baggage out of train.<br>
“You!!!”<br>
Salgado screamed once and used his wired to catch Leon's baggage.<br>
In a moment Salgado moved his eyes to baggage, Leon quickly draw his other gun and gave many shots to Salgado's leg.<br>
It was too late to avoid bullets using his hand when Salgado noticed it.<br>
One of Salgado's legs tore off by gun shots.<br>
Then he lost his balance and he tumble down from train roof.<br>
Leon saluted to Salgado and shouted,<br>
“Have a nice trip on wasteland! Salgado!”<br>
His face was filled with great joy of eliminating that [weird man].<br>
|<br>
He took a rest on the roof and then he went back to his sheet.<br>
It was covered by blood. Salgado had slayed all of passengers in this car just as next car.<br>
He could easily predict what will happen at the station when train conductor sees this mess.<br>
After a deep sigh, he closed his eyes, and then imagined of clean interior.<br>
He opened his eyes again hoping that his imagination had changed the world.<br>
However, it was still covered by blood.<br>
|<br>
After sneaking out of trouble at the station, Leon rode a horse for three days.<br>
And then he walked for four days. Sometime he encountered monsters during his trip on the wasteland,<br>
but those were like nothing to him compare to fight against weird man, Salgado.<br>
|<br>
After travelling a lot of days, he finally arrived to remain of [The Eye].<br>
He sat down on the rock and took the device out.<br>
While he was trying to recall engineer's explanation, he set the device on the ground.<br>
“Hmm...Was it like this??”<br>
When he pushed top part of device, it started to shine weirdly.<br>
Then he saw a vision of other world on top of the device.<br>
His memory of [Profound] flashed back in his head.<br>
If, in the worst case, this device goes out of control, it might create a new [Profound] in remain of the last Profound [The Eye].<br>
His own imagination made him sweat.<br>
“Oh crap! It's not going to be just a joke!...Should I followed Salgado???”<br>
|<br>
However, without having any trouble, the device kept quietly operating.<br>
It did not make any changes for two days.<br>
Leon was only asked to set the device; however, he decided to watch result of using this device.<br>
Salgado's gloomy voice was keep refraining in Leon's head.<br>
|<br>
Ten days later...<br>
Suddenly the device started to shine strongly.<br>
Leon noticed it from his camp.<br>
“...Okay...What's going to happen, now.”<br>
He moved close to device and started to watch it carefully.<br>
Device kept shining and the light from device started to form a luminous pillar.<br>
Then shadow of human started to appear inside.<br>
It was getting thicker and thicker. It was for sure that there is someone inside.<br>
Leon almost forgot to breathe while he was watching.<br>
When he took a long breath to calm down, someone came out from luminous pillar.<br>
“What the....”<br>
Leon lost all of his word when he saw that person from luminous pillar.<br>

33,118,1,"- Cage -",1,"She woke from a fitful nightmare to pain and the sound of someone talking nearby. Ayn had been asleep on a table in middle of endless dark. A single glaring light lit the table from above, pinning her to the table as she woke, confused.<br>
The owner of the voice was a boy, face distorted by shadow, staring at Ayn with a somehow indecisive expression. She couldn't remember what he'd said, but the echo of his voice clung to her fading dreams. Weak from her injuries, she lay motionless under his hollow stare, feigning sleep.<br>
She heard a door burst open and someone shuffle in. The sound gave form to the darkness more than the harsh light could, and the darkness shrank to the size of an room.<br>
“I thought I heard someone moving around in my basement, and of course it would be you. You know I've told you not to come in here without me,” said an old man hoarsely. He moved into the light from behind the boy, and from his face he seemed clearly amazed that the boy still didn't understand his warning.<br>
The old man saw the boy staring, and followed his intense gaze to the table where Ayn lay. ”So it's a cat this time? That's an interesting fur pattern. I don't believe I've seen its like around here.”<br>
“Isn't it? This time I don't think I'll need to <something about bones>, it'll look great stuffed,” said the boy.<br>
“If you're going to stuff it, that's going to take more than a little time. First we'll need to...” The old man's voice trailed off as he moved past the boy, deeper into the basement. The boy didn't take his eyes off of Ayn for an instant.<br>
After a while the old man came back laden with dusty books, turning pages in one tome in particular.<br>
“Hmmm, it seems first we'll have to flay its skin off.”<br>
Ayn's drowsiness vanished as she realised that she was in danger still. She fought desperately to muster the strength to get up and flee, but pain flashed through her body as she moved. The only result was agony and a faint whimper.<br>
The old man's head jerked up from his books in surprise. “Oh, it's still alive!”<br>
“Right, let's kill it.” The boy hoisted her by the tail violently, and through still more pain Ayn's blood turned to ice. He reached for a knife as Ayn hung limply in his grip, but the old man intervened.<br>
“Wait, please, you promised me you would only bring things which were already dead.”<br>
The boy froze, glaring passively at the old man. Ayn wondered for a moment if the boy would take the knife to him instead.<br>
“Rules are rules. I want you to learn to restrain yourself. You simply must be able to control your appetites.”<br>
The boy reluctantly put Ayn back down on the table, as though struggling with some quiet rage.<br>
“I guess I'll take care of it for the time being.” Suppressed, the boy vanished into the dark. Ayn heard him leave the room, and then she was alone with the old man. Ayn had somehow earned a stay of execution, but she still wasn't sure she trusted either of this odd pair.<br>
Nevertheless the old man generously saw to her most immediate injuries right there on the table, and repurposed a corner of the room with a tattered old blanket for her to rest on. He wouldn't let her leave the confines of the dim basement and she was too weak to anyway, even given opportunity. She wasn't locked in a cage, but there was still no way out.<br>
Time passed. Every day, the boy would appear with a new animal corpse. Ayn had freedom to move about the room, but she would always retreat to her corner when he appeared and started hacking his corpses apart. Only when the normally blank-faced boy was at his gory task would his face shine with enjoyment, and Ayn knew that his true interest lay not in taxidermy but in the preceding grisly dismemberment.<br>
One day after a particularly messy session he drew close to her corner, leaned menacingly over her and darkly whispered, “I really would like to have a go at stuffing you...” as Ayn trembled uncontrollably. She knew she had escape as soon as possible, but she was still too weak to act.<br>
In time she grew faint with hunger, slipping in and out of consciousness, unable to tell if she was awake or asleep, alive or dead. Her dreams were silent, but when she was awake the world outside the basement was noisy and violent. Or was it the other way around?<br>
She wasn't sure when it happened, but one day the boy stopped visiting. She had been preparing herself for the worst, for the boy's knife. Now she at least had some peace to die in.<br>
Some time afterwards, a terrifying dark outline appeared before her and she knew the boy had come back to take her apart. But the outline simply placed a small plate of food scraps in front of her and left. She devoured the meagre scraps senselessly, but by the end of the meal she felt her senses returning. The old man had saved her again.<br>
Thereafter he brought her food every day. Instead of the daily horror of the boy's visits she grew used to the old man's kind delivery. Sometimes the old man would linger in the basement, pottering about the bookshelves, napping in a chair at the table or busy at something or other. She started to feel her strength and purpose returning, the pain and hopelessness fading.<br>
|<br>
She woke up and knew something was different. The menacing dark lurking in the corners of the basement didn't seem so menacing any more. She was human again. As she stretched, she found that the wound that had taken all of her strength to walk with no longer hampered her movement.<br>
The old man was asleep in his chair at the table. Ayn silently got up and crept towards the door, holding her breath as she took a heavy coat from a rack next to it. Donning the coat, she opened the door as slowly as she could and slipped outside, with one last glance to make sure the old man was still sleeping.<br>
Outside, tiptoeing up the stone steps to ground level, the inky blackness of the night sky confirmed what she already knew. She couldn't see the single brilliant star she had seen in the forest before being injured, but as her eyes adjusted from the relative brightness of the basement she was transfixed by a radiant swath of millions of tiny sparkling pinpricks. She stepped out of the stairwell onto cobble, dizzily gazing upward in wonder.<br>
“I'd have lent you the coat if you'd asked, girl.”<br>
Ayn started at the sudden admonishment from behind and spun around to face the old man, awake and standing at the top of the steps. Her body tensed like a cat about to flee.<br>
“Can you spare a few minutes for a chat before you disappear? If you still want to run when you've heard what I have to say, I won't stop you. Take the coat if you like it.”<br>
She'd escaped from the basement and could probably outrun the old man even in her current state, but where would she go? She took in some more of her surroundings. She was at the base of some kind of tower, and she could make out dark walls jaggedy cutting at the fringes of the glowing sky. She still knew nothing about this world. She looked back at the old man, in this starlight somehow different; his back straighter, his features sharper.<br>
“You came from the other side of the Vortex, right? I've heard fantastic tales of the beings from over there, but this is the first time I've see living proof.Ayn shrank away as he stepped closer, but then he was already next to her, peering curiously at her ears. “Don't be silly girl, I've had weeks if I wanted to hurt you.” He examined her a moment longer then stepped away, satisfied.<br>
“Don't ask me how I know this, but the group that you are looking for is here in this world. They're also trying desperately to stop the Vortex crisis, but they don't really know what will happen on your side as a result of their efforts. I don't think they care enough to think about it, or maybe they just don't have time to. I imagine you feel the same way.”<br>
Ayn let her surprise show on her face. How could the old man know this? Even worse, her quarry seemed to be in the same situation as her. No matter, this world meant nothing to her, even knowing their situation. Her world came first, she still had to retrieve the Orb no matter what!<br>
“Tomorrow someone who shares a destination with you will stop by before his journey. If you wish to go along, I can arrange it. He may not share your goal, but at least he will lead you to the right place.”<br>
She was convinced. In the morning she would become a cat again, there would be no more chance to discuss matters. She had to learn more from this old man before she left him behind, so she stayed up to listen to him all night.<br>
The next day, the boy returned to the basement for the first time in a while. His normally placid expression was somehow cheerful.<br>
The boy strode towards the old man waving some kind of document in the air like a pennant.<br>
“Looks like father forgave me at last,” gushed the boy as he handed the letter to the old man.<br>
The old man took it from him when offered, and peered at it inquisitively. It was a letter of introduction for enlistment in the army, signed by royalty. The old man looked up from the letter thoughtfully. “The army you would certainly afford you much greater opportunity than this old castle basement.”<br>
“I know, Rofen. I bet it's just like you told me.”<br>
“Well I guess we should get you outfitted for your journey.”<br>
“What? I don't need anything you might have around here. I mean, I don't imagine any old swords you have would be all that useful.”<br>
“Well I can't argue with that, those army engineers are clever chaps. I bet almost anything they could come up with would trump my modest collection. Ok so you don't need equipment, but there is a favour I'd like to ask. A delivery I'd like made to an old friend...”<br>
The boy, Grunwald, raised his eyebrows as the old man, Rofen, passed him a wicker cage containing a small cat.<br>

34,136,1,"Year 3386. - Trainees -",1,"“That old fella!?”<br>
Friedrich, who was sitting on a spinning chair, sounded quite surprised. He then raised his head and looked at his twin brother, Bernhard.<br>
That [old fella] Friedrich referred to was well-known for his strictness. He was also known as a famous coach who could train the whole regiment trainees into top executors successfully.<br>
It seemed highly unlikely that he would abandon his duty as a training officer at this time of year, while the latest crew of trainees just began their training.<br>
By the time Friedrich joined the regiment, that particular training officer had already earned the title [Devil Hozz] due to his strictness.<br>
“Yep. Rumor has it he was called by those from the Pandemonium.”<br>
Bernhard continued his conversation with Friedrich while starting to prepare for the strike. Friedrich, who was on leave, watched him busying around relaxedly.<br>
“So those trainee newbies just got to get some days off? How lucky. ”<br>
“That, you need not worry at all. They've already chosen someone to be the deputy. ”<br>
“Do we have that kind of nosey people here in the organization? Aren't those caring captains and vice-captains also quite busy right now? ”<br>
“Actually, you, are the deputy, Friedrich.”<br>
Friedrich raised his head again looking at Bernhard, totally speechless.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“Urm. Due to many complicated reasons, I, Friedrich, am here to temporarily take over officer Hozz's position. Nice to meet you all. ”<br>
Friedrich looked into all trainees' eyes. Although he could still see some anxiety, everyone looked pretty good generally speaking. And young, too. He could tell all these men are well-chosen.<br>
Friedrich then flipped a few pages of the text book Bernhard gave it to him. The note was about statistical data related to vortex people found in the past and their characteristics.”<br>
“Urm. Where should we start then...'Vortex could be majorly categorized into four kinds depended on how severe the damage it could cause. And the quiteria to judging it was established in year 3332...'”<br>
Friedrich recited only a few lines before he snapped the book shut. He then inhaled deeply. All trainees turned their attentions from the textbooks laid in front of them to Friedrich.<br>
“Argh...this is so boring. You could all study it later by yourselves!”<br>
Friedrich said quite irresponsibly.<br>
“Good! No more studying. Let's go outside and have some real practice.”<br>
The sudden change of course made the whole classroom start to fuss around.<br>
“Back to the time when I was enlisted, we never had these kinds of craps. Let me teach you something more meaningful.”<br>
He then grabbed his coat, striding out ahead.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“So, urm.”<br>
Friedrich tossed his sword to a young man who was short and blond and was standing right in front of him. The young man didn't react in time, so the sword flying toward him fell directly on the ground. After a few spin, the sheaths got loosen and exposed the silver blade inside.<br>
“You. What's your name?”<br>
“...Izac.”<br>
“Good, Izac! I will just stand right here, totally unmoved.”<br>
Friedrich draw a circle on the ground which was about half an alle (About 75 cm) long in the diameter. He then stepped into the circle, holding two wooden swords, and prepared to launch a strike.<br>
“Just bring it on with that sword, young man! If you could make me leave this circle, I shall exempt you from all the exams related to sword techniques.”<br>
But Izac just stood there and hold the sword clumsily, making no move to launch a strike.<br>
“Take this seriously! Tried as hard as you could, as if you were about to kill me!”<br>
Seeing Izac making no moves, people around started to murmur sarcastically.<br>
“What's up, Izac! Still a coward I see!” “Let me do it, will you?”<br>
All other trainees started to make fun of him.<br>
Izac, who now seemed to make up his mind eventually, adjusted his breath and raised his sword. He then attacked Friedrich with agility.<br>
“Too light! Young man!”<br>
Izac's movements seemed to be at a loss. Friedrich then stabbed into Izac's abdomen, who just lost his balance after using the wooden sword to beat down Izac's sword.<br>
Izac fell to knees miserably. He rolled on the ground with agony, couldn't even make a sound.<br>
“I told you so! Take this seriously!”<br>
Friedrich told other trainees, ignoring Izac completely.<br>
“Next one. Same reward.”<br>
Soon enough, a young man with black hair and a pair of glasses walked to Izac, who was lying on the ground and picked up the sword besides him.<br>
“My name is Evarist. Please let me give it a try.”<br>
“Come then.”<br>
Friedrich could tell by the young man's postures how good he is. He seemed to have some talents.<br>
The young man then launched the attack with agility, measuring the distance with feet while fighting Friedrich restlessly.<br>
The tip of his sword went pass Friedrich's throat with no mercy.<br>
“Very good, just like that!”<br>
His sword did carry the will to [kill].<br>
He then launched his second and third strike without any pause.<br>
Friedrich kept dodging around to avoid the attack; a smile crept over his lips.<br>
“Good techniques, your spirit is quite good, too.”<br>
But his strength and speed were still far behind what a Regiment soldier, like Friedrich himself, required to equip.<br>
The young boy with black hair did not hear a word what Friedrich just said.<br>
“Time is up.”<br>
Friedrich beat down the boy's sword right after saying this, with the speed no trainees could ever see clearly.<br>
The young boy who just lost his sword was panting hardly while Friedrich looked perfectly fine. He didn't even have to adjust his breath.<br>
“How annoying. You are next. And you, right over there, go after him.”<br>
Friedrich said, pointing at the trainees with his sword and directed them to take the stand one by one.<br>
Time flew fast while practicing with one's whole body. Although each and every one of the trainees had challenged Friedrich, no one could even make him leave the circle he drew on the ground, not even one step.<br>
All trainees were now sitting tiredly on the ground; the only person who could still stand was Friedrich himself.<br>
“Well, that's about it I think. Nice exercise, huh? We are done for today then! Meal time!”<br>
Friedrich said vigorously, walking toward the dining hall ahead of everyone once again.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
There's no one in the dining hall yet, only those who were trained by Friedrich had started to eat.<br>
Friedrich had already finished his meal long before they changed their clothes.<br>
He was about to step out of the hall when he saw those two young boy he practiced with at the beginning of the training sessions.<br>
Since they were sitting together, he figured these two must be quite good friends. However, the pair also seemed to be pretty gloomy.<br>
“Hey you two.”<br>
He sat next to the boys with some drinks in his hand.<br>
The young men smiled back sadly.<br>
“Have you two getting used to here yet?”<br>
“Yeah, sort of.”<br>
The one with black hair replied.<br>
“Only [sort of]?”<br>
Friedrich laughed happily.<br>
“What you need to do is actually quite simple. Make yourself stronger, beat down monsters and stop Vortex from being active. That's all.”<br>
Izac ate his meal silently while Evarist did the talk mostly.<br>
“Well, I could only teach you guys something like that back there, couldn't I? I know it's quite different from what you learned from that old chap...I mean Hozz.”<br>
“Speaking of this, what term are you?”<br>
“Term 15.”<br>
“Really!? Seems that I my self are not young anymore.”<br>
“What term are you, then, sir?”<br>
“Me? Term3. Yep, regardless of how I look to you guys, I am actually quite senior here.”<br>
“Term 3...so you were enlisted in year 77?”<br>
“Not bad, young men! That's damn right, I am now in my 9th year.”<br>
Friedrich sat straight finally and asked Izac.<br>
“Hey you, boy. Ah...it's Izac, right? Get some more while you could still eat. You all need to grow a bit more.”<br>
“For the fight, right?”<br>
Evarist replied instead of Izac, who was being silent from the beginning.<br>
“Indeed...”<br>
After taking a deep breath, Friedrich told them warningly,<br>
“However, what you must consider above everything is to live. If you died, all things are gone.”<br>
“But, I thought we regiment do not fear of death and shall sacrifice ourselves in the cause of [fight for the world]? So it should be fine if we were dead because of the mission.”<br>
Evarist retorted.<br>
“Well, of course we would say that ostensibly. But if you don't try to live as long as you could, you won't be able to win the battle. Those who were loyal to these kinds of craps and those who praised the words [in the cause of world] were always the first ones to die.”<br>
“In other words, you must try to live through the battle -- even if it requires you to kill your enemies.”<br>
Friedrich said and turned to face Izac.<br>
“Izac, I have some hopes in you, you got me? Back there when you were rolling around with agony, the way you looked at me like you wanted me to die. That's it, don't you ever forget that!”<br>
Izac stopped eating and nodded.<br>
“Well, I shall go then. Take your time and eat some more!”<br>
Friedrich stood up.<br>
“Also, I am willing to be your practicing opponent whenever I am available. Call me if you two ever need me.”<br>
“Sure.”<br>
“Good. See you around then.”<br>
Friedrich said and left for his room.<br>

35,166,1,"- Black Holl -",1,"After sending off Ayn, The Worms became more and more active.<br>
Weird noises that could shake the earth were heard every now and then.<br>
Whenever she heard those noises caused by the shake of forest, birds and animals, the anxiety creeping inside Sprout would start to spread all over her body.<br>
One day, they finally found a thing that was similar to The Worms at the edge of the forest.<br>
Although they still couldn't tell whether it's a real Worm or not, they knew one thing for sure – if those were truly The Worms, it would take no time for them to eat out the whole forest.<br>
Under this kind of circumstances, injured soldiers due to The Darkness would all ignore Gramma's objections and go out to fight for the battle determinedly, even if they weren't recovered completely.<br>
“Don't do anything stupid. The Worms aren't something we could kill. Don't provoke them on purpose.”<br>
Gramma said slowly, as if giving them orders.<br>
“Even so, are we allowed to just sit around and wait for death?”<br>
A man looked like a leader who was standing among the soldiers gathering around Gramma said.<br>
“Can you possibly prevent the storms from coming? Can you possibly bear to hit by lightnings? Let's just wait, for now. Do not rush into things.”<br>
“We don't want to just sit and wait and die for nothing. If we were going to die, we will die like a warrior with dignity!”<br>
These soldiers, who just lost their battle, The Darkness, all looked determined and solemn.<br>
“Now we just wait.”<br>
“I see. But sorry, ma'am, we could no longer obey you, not anymore.”<br>
Gramma's decisions were usually wise and correct. But this time, she could no longer soothe these soldiers' anxiety.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Sprout was walking behind the soldiers. She couldn't bear to wait anymore either. She wanted to see the source of her own fear herself.<br>
Originally, Sprout planned to stay far behind the team; but of course her intention was see though by the warriors right away.<br>
“Hey, why are you sneaking around over there? What do you want?”<br>
The sound suddenly appeared behind Sprout startled her and almost made her jump. It was one of the soldiers got injured in The Darkness.<br>
“No matter what you were trying to do, don't even think about it. We are not going to kids' playground. Now off you go! Get back as soon as possible.”<br>
“I won't get in your way. I just want to know how these monsters look like.”<br>
Sprout told him her wishes honestly.<br>
“Well, seems that my idea of putting you off won't work anyway. I thought that once you got bored, you would head back eventually. That's why I didn't stop you at the beginning.”<br>
The injured warrior said, shaking his head and wondering what he should do with this Sprout girl.<br>
“Hey! Eason! Sward!”<br>
The warrior then yelled suddenly, with these two young soldiers appeared in front of Sprout right away.<br>
“Escort this young lady here back to the village.”<br>
Those young warriors grimaced instantly. Sprout had seen one of them before.<br>
“This is an order, do you understand? Now move!”<br>
“But The Worm...”<br>
“That, we can take care of! Now go!”<br>
The two young soldiers did not turn back to Sprout, not until they could no longer see those worms-fighters marching away. They then turned and faced her reluctantly, glaring.<br>
“You...you are the one who always clings to Ayn! Why? Why you two always like to get in my way?”<br>
The three therianthropes walked in the forest side by side. If there were no Darkness and Worms, they should be playing around like some normal kids right now.<br>
“Is everyone doing alright? What if the things Gramma said about The Worms were right, that they are monsters couldn't be killed...”<br>
No one made comment about this murmur.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Three days after Sprout and the two young soldiers back to the village, one of the other warriors also came back.<br>
Everyone could see there was death in his eyes. No matter what other therianthropes asked him, he just kept shivering. Although no one could get anything concrete from him, his reactions said everything about what had happened to those warriors fighting for the battle.<br>
He was the only one back in the village alive.<br>
One evening, a shattering sound came from the forest, a sound that was even louder than those before. A crevice that could barely squeeze one man in appeared at the edge of the forest.<br>
What happened next was more than strange – numerous Worms crept out of the earth.<br>
The Worms finally showed them selves to the children of forest.<br>
To Worms, the forest was merely food. Like fruits to birds; animals to people. The Worms always ate everything in the forest, leaving nothing behind.<br>
Soon enough, the crevice appeared at the edge of forest turned the whole place into a black hole. And Worms would go back to that dark hole when the night came.<br>
Villagers who had seen the hole were scared. They knew it would eventually envelope them all.<br>
Grampa and Gramma prayed day and night restlessly. This was the last thing they could do. However, after The Worms ate a whole tribe, they stopped doing so. It's time to make a new decision.<br>
“We shall move to a new forest, now.”<br>
Gramma said after gathering everyone together. The decision was reckless. Without the protection of The Orb, moving to other forest was just way too far and too dangerous. But no one made any complaints, they just accepted Gramma's decision without any questions. They all had to escape The Worms after all -- either that or wait till the whole tribe disappeared, or The Worms themselves stopped acting.<br>
They decided to head out of the forest the day after tomorrow.<br>
Just walk ahead along the opposite direction where the Worms launched the attack to the nearest forest – this is the only instruction they got.<br>
During the meting Gramma held that night, Sprout had seen her parents and Ayn's as well. They all tried very hard to hide their anxiety and forced themselves to smile.<br>
“Do not worry.”<br>
“Everything will be just fine.”<br>
She knew clearly that all these were lies.<br>
What Sprout had feared the most would soon become real – the world she lived would turn into emptiness; got no where to run, nor any place to hide; all men were trapped, no one could ever escape.<br>
When the meeting was over and everyone was heading to their home getting some rest, Sprout left home and ran toward the wreckage of the tribe caused by the hole.<br>
She just had to see the cause of all these chaos, no matter what. In her young mind, she just needed to know the [cause] even if her whole world were about to vanish.<br>
Though she had walked quite a long way, the end of forest was still a place no kids could ever reach by foot.<br>
|<br>
When morning came, Sprout was still walking. It wasn't long before she lied tiredly under a tree. The forest was as deserted and desolated as always.<br>
She sat on a trunk, bearing her head in her hands and closed her eyes. She soon fell into sleep.<br>
In her dream, she saw Ayn. She saw her running in an unknown forest, sweet and caring as usual.<br>
After Ayn left, Sprout was sad and regretful to the fact that she didn't try to stop her. But now she felt different. She was glad Ayn wasn't in this world anymore. Because Ayn would be saved now, she knew.<br>

36,20004,1,"- Winter Festival -",1,"They just kept walking ・walking in a place that's as cold as ice.<br>
The two soldiers being brought back to life were marching ahead carefully with all their fighting weaponry equipped. They were even more careful than they usually were.<br>
This is just way too cold, isn't it, Eva?・<br>
Izac asked Evarist, who was walking ahead of him.<br>
True. But actually, I think it's fine for us. As for her・<br>
The two former emperor-warriors contemplated the automata, who was now their master besides them cautiously while cleaning away the snow obstructing them along the way.<br>
During this journey, everything they had encountered was far from what they used to know in the old world. Here, they just kept heading toward with the automata girl on a land that's not even existed in the real world. They just followed her orders, whether it's toward the hot, dry desert; the nest of devils; or a well-hidden mountain full of treasure that no one ever knew.<br>
|<br>
They had survived numerous crises. They were walking on a journey of retrieving memories.<br>
Izac, who just finished a battle was being more talkative than hey usually were probably because of the surroundings, because of these strange snow.<br>
Right after I took down that bastard, I reminded something while I was little. Do you still remember that big bag our Lordship from the Main Hall always carries around?”<br>
Evarist tried to recall those childhood memories so long ago.<br>
“Hmmmm, are you talking about Father?”<br>
Memories during his time living in the Main Hall were the only normal ones Evarist had ever had in his whole life, or maybe the closest ones.<br>
“I remember our Lordship was so terrible at costuming that we make fun of him about that every single year.”<br>
“Hmmmm, indeed.”<br>
Evarist's father was the Lordship of their kingdom, but he possessed a characteristic completely contrary to what a Lordship should possess. He gave Evarist birthday presents every year. He even prepared gifts for Izac every year, too, even if he was just a son of his servants. He treated them like they were both his own. He always dressed like a snow fairy during the Winter Festival, even though Evarist's mother and all the servants would criticize and rebuke him about how inappropriate it was.<br>
These memories were all still very fuzzy a while ago, even he himself couldn't recall correctly. But now, after the battle, he started to remember them bits by bits.<br>
They were composed by memories -- the only reason why they still existed. Among everything, the only one thing they could be sure was that even if they did not actually exist in the real world, memories of families still formed part of Evarist's body, his existence.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
The Lordship was in the Main Hall of the Lordship with young Evarist and Evarist's mother standing besides him.<br>
One day, a new servant just appeared out of nowhere and started working in the Hall.<br>
“Come now, Izac, introduce yourself to everyone.”<br>
Young Evarist realized instantly that the child hiding far behind must be Izac.<br>
“My name is Izac, nice to meet you all.”<br>
Evarist then replied.<br>
“Hello, Izac. My name is Evarist. But Father always calls me Eva.”<br>
“Oh. Hello, Eva.”<br>
The above conservation made Izac's father blanch instantly. Even though Evarist was just the son of the Lordship, not the Lordship himself, his son's behavior was still far too imprudent.<br>
“You little bastard, Izac! I am truly sorry, my Lord, that my son dared to speak this shamelessly. I am terribly sorry.”<br>
By the frightened way his father acted, Izac knew he went a little too far. He then began apologizing as well.<br>
But he was soon stopped by Evarist's father, who was keeping a small distance from them up until now.<br>
“It's alright, no need to apologize. Izac, I am entrusting my son to your care then.”<br>
Since all men must obey everything the Lordship said, Izac's father as a servant had no choice but to accept the order no matter how unwillingly he was. Even Izac understood why his father would worry about this. He never called Evarist [Eva] in front his father again.<br>
|<br>
From that day on, Evarist and Izac became friends.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Bang!<br>
|<br>
The sudden crash startled Evarist, making him all-prepared and alerted as if he were about to launch a battle.<br>
But what had hit him was just a snow ball. Upon realizing, he turned around right away and started searching Izac.<br>
“Izac, don't act like an idiot and doing all these stupid, boring things!”<br>
“Haha. Or what? You are going to bite me?”<br>
Another snow ball flew to him. Evarist dodged deftly and missed the hit.<br>
“Not bad! How about this?”<br>
“Stop it!”<br>
Evarist grabbed a fistful of snow besides him and threw it back.<br>
“Haha, you missed it! Loser!”<br>
Ignoring him, Evarist started heading toward again after taking a deep breath.<br>
“You are boring. Why not played along?”<br>
Izac ran next to Evarist and said.<br>
“Look at you, how relaxing.”<br>
“What else should I do then, in such a weird place? Worrying too much won't get you anything.”<br>
“Hmmmm, that's true.”<br>
Evarist agreed, smiling sourly.<br>
“By the way, it's my turn to lead the way. You go get some rest.”<br>
Izac walked past him and started to lead the team, continued walking into the snow ahead of them.<br>
Evarist asked the automata followed behind them.<br>
“Are you alright? Don't worry. We will be out of here, soon. ”<br>

37,176,2,"Year 3394. - The First Battle -",1,"“We lost again...?”<br>
A deep sigh came from the meeting room. All military officers lowered their head shamefully while the civil officers threw the reports on the table grumpily.<br>
Their battle with The United Kingdom of Rubyonar had come into second year.<br>
Before the war began, The Granderania Empire was the most powerful kingdom in the world. However, with The Troyde Fortress, the so called [the safest and strongest fortress of history], they couldn't defeat their Rubyonar enemies successfully. Moreover, ever since the defeat, they started to lose almost every battle. They not only lost almost half of The Third Army, but also lost several famous military generals. In addition, the armored troops of the Rubyonar Kingdom even continued their pursuing after the victory, forcing the army of Empire to flee frighteningly.<br>
After that, the Empire's army tried to take down the fortress for another few times, but could never find a way in. In stead, they were ambushed by enemies from almost everywhere, causing even more casualties. Civil officers who were always kind and gentle started to object too, requesting the emperor to call for a truce. Among them, Chief Katton, the so called [the great planner of the Emperor] was the most aggressive one.<br>
“If we call for a truce now, we might still be able to reach an understanding that's more favorable to us with them. However, if we keep losing like this, our enemy will soon realize what our limit is”<br>
“You're right! Our people are tired too. We really should stop this meaningless and harmful war at once.”<br>
Agreeing with Chief Katton's opinion, more and more people stood out and asked for calling a truce. As for the military officers, although they still kept defending themselves and were objected to the anti-war choice, they did not speak out aloud ・considered they were indeed losing after all. Then, just while the anti-war chattering became more and more passionate, a loud and clear sound startled everyone in the room.<br>
“What the hell are you all talking about? If we call for a truce now, our emperor's reputation, no, our Lordship's reputation will be harmed! We can't quit simply because of losing once or twice. That's not going to happen. No way at all!”<br>
The noisy meeting room went silent at once. Everyone in the room looked at the person who just spoke simultaneously. Office Katton tsked unhappily. It was General Cidre, the military officer with the highest rank in the whole Emperor. He was also the chief commander in the Battle of Troyde Fortress.<br>
“General Cidre, despite of what you have just said, we are still losing along the whole west line, are we not? Don't you think losing battles continuously, having our Lordship forced to face all these causalities day after day will cause more harm to our Lordship's reputation?”<br>
General Cidre frowned at Officer Katton, who was becoming more and more hysterical as he spoke.<br>
“Only those who had never fought in a battle will talk about theses craps like 'no failures but only victories'. If we started to back off on account of these few battles, what's going to happen in the future? What will other emperors think of us and treat us?<br>
“So, General, are you implying we could still take down the Fortress of Troyde, even though we've already failed several times?<br>
“As long as we take the Galleon with us, that fortress could be easily taken down.”<br>
“The Galleon? Do you mean that relic from the last century; the thing even has difficulty moving? How humorous you are, General Cidre!”<br>
Katton laughed, and all the civil officers around him started to laugh loudly too, while Cidre looked quite pleased with himself, however.<br>
“The Galleon is now ready for battle. With it being our core of combat, my new army will show you all our success!”<br>
Realizing what he had said, Katton looked quite surprised.<br>
“What!? Do you even think you can get away with this? Deciding to alternate the ship on your own...”<br>
“I have already asked for our Lordship's permission. We will not attack the Fortress of Troyde directly. Instead, we will use it to cross The Norzon River and win a battle there.”<br>
“Wh...what?? No way, our Lordship could never...”<br>
Cidre concluded the meeting as Katton totally lost his tongue, couldn't even speak another word.<br>
|<br>
Outside the cacophonic meeting room which was becoming noisier and noisier as the meeting ended, a young woman looked quite worried stood by the wall. She was twisting her long hair with her index finger. Her hair nearly reached her waist. She seemed like a girl waiting for her lover, totally out of place in this rough, stony frontline base.<br>
Cidre walked out of the meeting room and came to her side.<br>
“Sorry to keep you waiting, Belinda. Those who object to the idea are more annoying than I thought.”<br>
“It's alright. I didn't wait long.”<br>
The young woman whose name was Belinda smiled calmly.<br>
“So, everyone agrees with me now?”<br>
“Well, I didn't give them much choice, did I? As soon as I told them this is an order came from our Lordship, no one dared to say another word.”<br>
Hearing the news, Belinda grinned genuinely like a child just received a toy.<br>
“So, I could just strike ahead, no need to hesitate then?”<br>
“Of course.”<br>
“Thank you, General Cidre!.”<br>
“You don't have to thank me. All you got to do is win the war. That's all.”<br>
“I understand that completely. Please just wait and see, General. With the Galleon and my power, I am sure we will win our first battle.”<br>
“I look forward to your performance, General Belinda.”<br>
Cidre turned around and walked away from Belinda after saying that.<br>
Belinda, who had such a gentle and sweet appearance, was actually the chief commander of the newly formed special armored assault team of the emperor.<br>
After saluting toward the direction Cidre just headed to, Belinda walked toward the opposite direction.<br>
“The battle, sounds of swords hitting each other and the stink smell of blood and glory. ohhhhhh....”<br>
The low murmurings came from Belinda's beautiful, smiley lips were heard by no one, only absorbed by the grey stone walls around.<br>
|<br>
|<br>
One week later.<br>
Today was the first day her special armored assault team stroked a battle. Belinda was standing on the deck sailing above The Norzon River, directing her army.<br>
They were still fighting along the river liked they had done before while attacking the Fortress of Troyde. However, no one anticipated that they could beat down the enemies this successfully.<br>
|<br>
Booom...!<br>
|<br>
A loud sound came from the armored ship's fort battery. The ground below them then exploded after that. Soldiers fighting for the kingdom were blown everywhere. Meanwhile, the army of the Emperor furthered their attacks and took down the rest. With the armored spaceship hovering above them, the Kingdom's soldiers had no chance of winning but to flee.<br>
“That's right. Keep heading toward slowly like this. Let's destroy everything our enemies have, leaving absolute nothing behind!”<br>
The Emperor's soldiers yelled their agreements loudly, their replies echoing with Belinda's sweet voice. It took them only one hour to finish the whole battle. All the struggles they had before were like dreams. They had won an overwhelming victory.<br>
After seeing their victory, Belinda smiled peacefully. One might thought she was being delighted because of their victory, but once they listened to her whisper carefully, they would probably frown and feel quite confused.<br>
“...Oh...I am surrounded by numerous deaths. How come deaths bring me such joy I really don't know. But more, I just need more! Please give me more deaths! Your deaths!”<br>
Belinda spread out her arms and looked up at the sky, as if she were taking a shower. Her eyes were shining like stars, and also a little bit frantic.<br>
|<br>
Woo-hoooooooooo!<br>
|<br>
Those who were in favor of expanding their kingdom but went silent because of the previous losing regained their power once again. With the new born heroine, people started to advocate the idea of launching a war.<br>
On the other hand, the anti-war party led by Office Katton suffered greatly. All the efforts of embracing peace had gone to waste, and the only thing they could do now was bear down.<br>
|<br>
|<br>
Belinda, the heroine who had returned in triumph was now standing in the palace's patio with Cidre after reporting back their victory.<br>
“Well done, Belinda.”<br>
“The credit should go to The Galleon.”<br>
Cidre was holding a wine glass and smiling happily.<br>
“The Fortress of Troyde is our next battle. As soon as we take it down, the enemies shall all crumple under our attack, I believe.”<br>
“Yes, sir.”<br>
“All things are in your hands now.”<br>
“I understand.”<br>
Belinda's long hair waved gracefully in the winter sky, as if answering the cold wind. However, there were no sparkles at all in her eyes, unlike the frantic way she acted in the battle field.<br>

38,147,1,"Year 3378. - The Pursuer -",1,"Marguerite had long realized what would happen if some outsiders found out the research she was conducting. She had no reason at all to forget the huge chaos caused by Pandemonium's [clean up].<br>
All researches regarding Chaosium were deemed as [heretics]. All researchers were required to give up and destroy their records and experimental results related to it once they were caught. Those Engineers who were stubborn and refused to do so had all either ended up dead or hidden in the Main Land below them, running away from Pandemonium,<br>
Even though knowing how dangerous this could be, she also knew there's no better place to conduct her research than here, in Pandemonium. This research needed to be done as soon as possible, now was not the time to leave. However, though she had been particularly careful and meticulous, the Inquisitors still found her.<br>
“We got a tip saying that you are conducting researches against The Rule here. Please come with us to the head quarter first. We will need to take over all the equipments here, too.”<br>
That was an exclamation no one could argue with, not a request, not to mention the fact that these people weren't someone she could afford to stand up against. Therefore, Marguerite had no choice but to comply with the Inquisitors obediently.<br>
|<br>
When they arrived the head quarter, The Base, her hands and feet were soon being cuffed and chained.<br>
“If you could please send me back before my kid's meal time, I would be forever grateful.”<br>
No one answered Marguerite's joke. They all started to prepare, making Marguerite realized immediately what would happen soon.<br>
“Now we are ready for your testimony.”<br>
The Inquisitor said, and Marguerite almost laughed inadvertently. She knew clearly what was about to happen could never be this easy.<br>
Rather than taken interest in Marguerite's research itself, the Inquisitor in front if her seemed more curious about the people she had contacted with while conducting the researches – those so called [The Revolutionaries]. However, though she did exchange some vital information with the Revolutionaries from time to time, she didn't reveal anythingabout them. Truthfully speaking, she didn't even know clearly about their backgrounds.<br>
“No matter how many more times you wish to question me, I still can't answer the things I had no clue with.”<br>
Marguerite insisted that all her research were done by herself alone from the very beginning.<br>
The research was her only hope to save her son successfully. No matter what would happen, she'll definitely continue her research. For that, and that alone, she had to get out of here. And in order to do so, she couldn't let herself being deemed as a Revolutionary – once they concluded that she was one of them, she would never be able to walk out of here again.<br>
“Though our methods here are quite primitive, they proved to be truly useful. There's no point keep resisting.”<br>
“Ouch...”<br>
After numerous times of intense electric shock, Marguerite finally passed out.<br>
|<br>
Being questioned by the same questions again and again, and then tortured by intense electric shock after answering them with the same content. The whole procedure repeated almost endlessly, until she lost conscious. Then, after she woke up, everything would start all over again.<br>
Even though Marguerite was already too weak to answer the questions fluently, the Inquisitors were still cruel and cold and keep holding the [hearing]. While she was wasting her own time here in such a terrible place, her child's valuable time was being wasted, too. She had to get back to her research as soon as possible. She couldn't afford to waste another minute, not even a second. The anxiety of being unable to see her child kept growing and growing.<br>
She screamed and yelled, wanting to fight her way out, but of no avail of course. She was soon electrified and passed away again.<br>
Though she had been tempted once and started to consider revealing everything in exchange of her freedom, she didn't do it eventually. She would probably put her child's life at risk if doing so, she told herself. This was the only thing that still keeps her awake, letting her to stay alert and resist the temptation of revealing everything.<br>
All her strength of fighting came from the faith in saving her child and putting him out of misery.<br>
|<br>
When she next woke up, she was no longer cuffed or chained. Marguerite was now in a place looked like an exam room, lying on an exam table. Iozeph was waiting besides her.<br>
“Iozeph!”<br>
She called out her husband's name weakly. After a short pause, Iozeph went pulling Marguerite into his arms quickly.<br>
“Where's our baby...?”<br>
“Healthy as always, waiting for you of course! Come on, let's go home.”<br>
Though he was smiling, Marguerite could still tell he was very tired. Iozeph did not tell Marguerite that he had been running around busily, trying to rescue her life.<br>
Iozeph then supported Marguerite by his arm, walking out of the head quarter with her together.<br>
“Even though you are a senior engineer, there won't be a next time. Please do keep that in mind.”<br>
An Inquisitor standing next to the exit warned Marguerite and Iozeph coldly.<br>
|<br>
When they got back to the lab, they found out that all their equipments and devices were gone. Their records of research and Codex were all disappeared too.<br>
“As long as you are safe and sound, none of this matters.”<br>
However, Marguerite just couldn't nod away Iozeph's gentle whispers, as if nothing really matters. She knew she was about to get some breakthrough and found something important. But now, everything was back to the start. Marguerite couldn't feel more awful and remorseful about this.<br>
“Anyway, just don't ever do things like this that will attract Inquisitor's attentions, alright?”<br>
“...I won't give up.”<br>
Marguerite told him, while stroking her child's face. Her son was asleep on a tiny bed.<br>
“I can still do that, I still have the chance...”<br>
There won't be a next time. That's what the Inquisitor said. But even if she did exactly what they told her to do so, her child still won't be cured. Every time she thought of her child's future, she felt nothing but restless, even agitated. She couldn't just sit and wait. There's no way she could bear with this.<br>
Although she had no interest at all in the Revolutionaries' backgrounds and their principles, she had no choice but to rely on them under this circumstance.<br>
“The Inquisitors have eyes everywhere. The chances of you encountering dangers are highly likely. If you do run into troubles, please come to Passtruss, we should be able to help.”<br>
A liaison she had been in contacted with not too long ago told her.<br>
Shortly after the [clean up], the security force burned down the whole research institute in Passtruss. Probably due to the fact that was a place of paramount importance to the Revolutionaries. However, Marguerite still went to the relics that used to be their institute, in order to get in touch with the Revolutionaries.<br>
She arrived the relics around midnight. The whole property was desolate -- not only the relics of institute, but also their surroundings. This area had become abandoned.<br>
“What you just encountered was truly unfortunate. I was wondering when you will be back. It's about time, I assumed.”<br>
A voice appeared behind her suddenly and startled Marguerite. She then turned around. The man standing there was the liaison she had seen several times.<br>
Marguerite looked around wildly while the liaison man figured as much.<br>
“Don't worry, there's no one else around here. I won't be here if otherwise.”<br>
“I want to continue on my research. I need help.”<br>
“You didn't lose the trial. You are already one of us. We will do our best to assist you.”<br>
“I just want to continue on my research. I don't have much time left.”<br>
“I understand. Let's go then. To a place that would meet all your requirements.”<br>
Riding the Clipper he had prepared and hid in somewhere else in advance, Marguerite and the liaison left the relics together.<br>
The Clipper was sailing low in the night sky. After going around the Passtruss, they landed on an empty ground. Nothing could be seen here, not even a road lamp.<br>
“Where are we...?”<br>
Marguerite was now in a place somewhere belongs to Pandemonium still, but she didn't even know its existence until now.<br>
“Do you know The Adjusting Zone? The area that central department reorganizes regularly. Pandemonium is a city entirely human-made, so it's of paramount importance to reorganize it regularly.”<br>
“Can I conduct my research here?”<br>
“We found a loop hole in the central control system. This allows us to stay out of their reach temporarily.”<br>
The empty ground then sank down slowly toward the heart of earth.<br>
After that, Marguerite vanished from Pandemonium and disappeared completely; leaving her husband and the child she was so attached with.<br>
|<br>
A few months later, Marguerite and the researchers from the Revolutionaries finished a very huge project called [The Cradle]. The Artificial Chaosium Vortex they developed could bring the Effective Energy to the person one assigned specifically.<br>
All tests were finished. It's time to bring my child here – the only thing I still got to do.<br>
It was late at night. Iozeph heard some noises and woke up. It felt like someone else was in the room.<br>
The chance of thieves breaking in was rather small in Pandemonium, not to mention the alarm didn't go off either.<br>
“Marguerite? Is that you?”<br>
Iozeph said and turned on the light. Marguerite was there, holding their child.<br>
“What are you going to do to the child?”<br>
“Don't ask anything. Just know that as soon as I finish this, the three of us could live together forever. That would be enough, wouldn't it?”<br>
“You have to understand that I am very worried about you.”<br>
“I have to go now. But we will be back. We will.”<br>
Marguerite then left the room with her child.<br>
Iozeph did not go after her. He just sat down on the bed, staring at emptiness for a while.<br>
He then sighed deeply and reached to the communication device set on the bedside table.<br>
“This is Iozeph. Yes, she was here. With the child, yes. The transmitter works fine.”<br>

39,157,1,"Year 3378. - The Cordex -",1,"Several beasts fell down silently behind Donita, who was holding a giant scythe, “This should be the last one.”<br>
Donita didn't turn back to confirm, but just murmured quietly to herself.<br>
She didn't look ecstatic with the victory, nor did she look proud of herself and her strongness. Taking down beasts strolling through the wilderness like what she just did was never a burden to her.<br>
“This is so time-consuming. All these animals have no strength at all, only got great quantity...”<br>
Donita said while one of the Automatas standing silently next to her.<br>
Another Automata picked up its sword slowly.<br>
“Well, you seemed to be more or less helpful under this circumstance. However, it would be even better if you can act upon your own judgment, still.<br>
The Automata referred as the Pro Type by Doctor remained unmoved toward Donita's complaints. Unless it was a direct order, or it won't respond at all.<br>
“No response? Such a boring toy. Let's go!”<br>
Donita walked past the Automata and led the way after saying so.<br>
Their goal was to reach that huge, giant building standing ahead.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
This building, which was half-collapsed and exposed to the terrible weather looked like an enormous beast at first glance. The empty hole at the center seemed like a beast's mouth.<br>
Normal people would feel terrified instantly upon seeing the appearance of this building, but not Donita. She just walked straight into the building, as if she were only about to take a walk.<br>
The place Donita just stepped in was the relic of an institute used to study the Chaosium.<br>
Relics from the Twilight Age could be seen all over the place on the main land. Donita was here to look for something on Doctor Walken's order.<br>
Once upon entering the relics, there was a grand plaza waiting ahead. It was dark inside; one could even catch the smell of rusted metal and rotten water.<br>
Even though it was built by the high-end technology during the Twilight Age, no things could escape the destiny of disintegration as times went by, it seemed.<br>
“Where could that thing be? I guess it should be well-kept deep inside somewhere...”<br>
|<br>
Donita looked around at the plaza. There was a path toward inside at the front and a staircase leading down on the right. Although there did exist another staircase leading a way toward upstairs, it was collapsed completely and of no use now.<br>
Though she did feel a bit worried and hesitated about the situation at hand, Donita still made up her mind and walked straight ahead into the path in front of her quickly while the Pro Type followed behind, clanking slightly along the way.<br>
Upon entering the tunnel, Donita started searching everywhere thoroughly and carefully.<br>
This building used to have tons of researchers staying onsite, so it was totally way too big for them -- two people only -- to root around the whole area.<br>
Donita, who was quite optimistic at the beginning and believed that she could soon recover the thing they were looking for began to feel agitated and restless as well as times went by.<br>
“Not even a clue...There's nothing here either!”<br>
After searching around countless paths, Donita sighed deeply -- a very human-like expression that Automata could never equip.<br>
|<br>
Sunlight that beat through the crevices had started to fade down; the whole building was now enveloped by darkness.<br>
“It's already this late!”<br>
Searching in darkness wasn't a trouble for Donita the Automata. Her eyes were designed to have much more efficiency than normal human ones.<br>
However, Doctor Walken did tell her to “Take a rest every now and then, it's compulsory.” And that if she couldn't find the thing in two days, she must return to the institute belongs to the doctor.<br>
|<br>
“But...the searching mission will fail if I stop looking.”<br>
If she took a rest now, she won't be able to keep searching in this huge building. And if that's the case, she would definitely go back to that...dark place again.<br>
“...it's okay. I don't need to rest. I can keep searching around.”<br>
Donita told the others her decision determinedly, worrying her bottom lips.<br>
She then turned her head and said to the Pro Type standing next to her.<br>
“Let's roll then! You wooden puppet.”<br>
Donita then walked together toward the next room with the Pro Type, who moved suddenly as if it were being bumped.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
The sun rose again, and the dusk came once more as well.<br>
Donita, who never stopped her searching, not even once, to have some rest finally appeared to relax a bit and brighten up. Her face was all covered by dust and rust.<br>
“This...this might be what we are looking for!”<br>
At the very bottom of this collapsed relic, Donita was holding a box in a room flooded by knee-high muddy water.<br>
What Donita was looking for -- something called The Cordex -- was a document recording the lost technology form the past. Though it was called a manuscript, the document itself could be any form, including memory chips, voice recorders or even passed by words of mouth.<br>
Donita herself was created based on the knowledge contained in The Cordex as well.<br>
There were many complex mechanics in the box Donita found. Even though they have been soaked in dirty water for this long, they were not affected by it at all, not even a scratch on the surface or being slightly rusted.<br>
“I could now go back to doctor very proud!”<br>
I could finally prove myself being useful.<br>
“I did it! I finally did it!”<br>
Donita cried out happily. Her cheers echoed in this room full of dirty water, and then died out in darkness at last.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
By the time they left the building, the sun had already gone down.<br>
It's been a few days since the operation first started, but Donita wasn't tired at all.<br>
“Seems that I don't need to sleep and rest after all.”<br>
This thought made Donita feel that there was a light shining through the darkness inside her heart.<br>
Then out of a sudden, she saw something else in her smiling eyes -- those animal bodies she took down before they went into the relic.<br>
Those beasts were unconscious now; they couldn't even walk on their own. They were just meats, totally dead man walking.<br>
And that's the difference between them and Donita. Realizing this, Donita was even happier than before.<br>
“Hey, you wooden puppet. Don't dawdle anymore. Let's go!”<br>
That's right.<br>
I am completely different from this wooden puppet and those dead meats that couldn't make a sound anymore.<br>
“Dadalalala-- Lalala--”<br>
Donita left the abolished relic joyfully, humming to herself all the way out.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“It's a pity indeed. The document you brought back is not The CorDex itself.”<br>
Donita, who just got back from her searching mission, did not get the compliments she expected.<br>
“No way...how's that even possible...”<br>
“It was actually made by high-end techniques as well, it seems.”<br>
The doctor told her and took out the mechanics from their box, starting to study them.<br>
“But the thing I was looking for was not the mechanics made by its lost technique, but the technique itself.”<br>
“...I,”<br>
Seeing the depressed way Donita acted and how miserable she sounded, the doctor said quickly.<br>
“Nevertheless, this mechanic was also very valuable and precious. I believe we could figure out some of the lost techniques by studying it.”<br>
He then patted her head gently.<br>
“You did well, Donita.”<br>
If this was what Donita first heard when she got back, she might feel happy.<br>
Or if she were a stupid puppet without its own will.<br>
However, Donita could tell that the doctor was lying. He was telling her white lies. So it hurt Donita's ego instead.<br>
“I am truly sorry...”<br>
If I kept failing like this, I will soon become useless.<br>
“Doctor, please let me go there once more...”<br>
I want to go search around again. I will definitely bring back a better result and present it to the doctor by doing so.<br>
But the doctor just shook his head, smiling.<br>
“Donita, why don't we take a rest first? Resting is necessary for you.”<br>
“Sleep...again?”<br>
“Yes. You must be very tired after searching for so long.”<br>
“No! I am not tired at all! Not even when I was searching....”<br>
Sleep was terrifying. Everything will be enveloped by darkness. Donita was afraid of that feeling.<br>
That silent beast's dead body appeared in Donita's head suddenly. Disgusting and terrible.<br>
“Donita, you are a good child. Now go have some rest.”<br>
Regardless of how reluctant Donita was, the doctor still reached out his hand and turned she off.<br>
“I really don't want to sleep, not anymore...”<br>
However, just right before she was about to speak out her own opinions, Donita was shut down and went unconscious.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
After that, Donita went search that relic on the main land several times again.<br>
But she could never recover The Cordex.<br>
“It's not something we can easily find.”<br>
The doctor will smile comfortingly at Donita every time she failed and came back.<br>
But it was no comfort at all to Donita.<br>
Because she would be forced to sleep after that.<br>
To her, sleeping was no different than death.<br>
Soon, Donita began to believe that this was her death punishment, for that she could never complete her mission successfully.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Then, after numerous times of being [dead], a man appeared in front of Donita after she finished her searching in the relic again.<br>
“You are the automata named Donita, correct?”<br>
“...who are you?”<br>
“Me? I am your rescuer.”<br>
“To rescue me?”<br>
“That's right. We could rescue you from the darkness, but only if you would be willing to assist us.”<br>
“From the darkness...”<br>
What kind of silly jokes was he talking about?<br>
Donita was about to laugh away.<br>
However, she was caught by something between the lines that man just said.<br>
“...”<br>
|<br>
“So, it all depends on what you intend to do now.”<br>
“...let me hear you out first, then. Go ahead.”<br>

40,9,1,"Year 3398. - The Idol -",1,"He has tons of enemies--a fact he had long realized. He never once let down his guard, not even when he was residing in the inland.<br>
He never intended to forget this anyway. From other people's points of views, his success and power all came from the queen and his background. He knew this seemingly solid power was actually very dangerous.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
After meeting with a certain person, Evarist was now on his way back. Then all of a sudden, the wagon Evarist was riding stopped midway in a deserted and desolated corner.<br>
He waited for a while, but the stable boy did not react or respond. His guard was totally surprised about this, so decided to get off the wagon and take a look at what had just happened. However, just when he left the wagon door, there came a huge gun shot.<br>
Even though it was proved that they were now under attack, Evarist still remained unmoved. Moreover, he felt that it was actually his luck the attacker had already taken down his guard, so that he could make the best use of his [power].<br>
Judging from the time gap between the exact moment his guard took the bullet and the gun shot he heard, Evarist figured out the approximate location and distance where the attacker was.<br>
It didn't seem like a wise move to get off the wagon without knowing how many attackers were out there, Evarist thought. He decided to wait for a while and see how everything went first. However, it was dead silent outside.<br>
Was it an elaborate warning? Or were they just planning for next step?<br>
No matter what, he had no choice but to break the ice now. Therefore, Evarist opened the door opposite to the one his guard had used before and got off the wagon. There weren't anyone within his eyesight, so Evarist took out his gun instead and ran toward the building ahead of him.<br>
However, just when he was about to reach his destination, Evarist felt a wave passing through him.<br>
Although he was shot in the arm and lost balance because of that, Evarist still made it and was now hiding under a shelter.<br>
Whoever attacked him were no ordinary people. And they weren't just trying to warn him either. Their goal was to kill him. Evarist realized this through the shot he just took.<br>
Evarist laughed mockingly at himself for being this careless. He was running out of time. Those assassins had long set up the whole attack and would soon come near him. He must found a way out, no matter how.<br>
There was a wandering path connected to the shelter he was hiding under. Evarist was now pressing hard against the gun shot wound on his arm and running toward that path.<br>
It was late at night, Evarist ran alone in the capital city of the Empire, with one of his hand pressing hard upon the bloody wound. No one else could be seen in the nightfall, only his own shadow.<br>
Upon entering a narrow ally, Evarist soon leaned against the wall and listened to the surroundings carefully. No sigh of enemies chasing after him, it seemed. Evarist took a deep breath and looked up at the sky. The night sky looked as usual as always. However, when Evarist lowered his head, he found himself staring at a poster of himself on the wall right in front of him.<br>
“Everything we do, we do for the Granderani Empire!”<br>
The Evarist drawn in the poster looked so brave and full of power.<br>
The fact that Evarist managed to become this successful without coming from a noble family or a political family in the emperor was the reason why many youngsters admired him so much. This was also the reason why the department of publicity would use him as the theme of these posters. His stories proved to be quite useful when the emperor needs to enhance people's morale.<br>
“Hmmmmmm.....”<br>
Compare to the brave look he seemed in the poster, Evarist was now totally a wreck - not only did he have to bare with the pain caused by the wound, he also had to look out for the enemies as well. Thinking of the huge difference between now and then, Evarist laughed bitterly involuntarily.<br>
What do I do now? Evarist considered his options.<br>
Because he was traveling secretly, so it would definitely be too late to wait for his companions and underlings noticing any extraordinary. He couldn't page them either.<br>
Should he just hid here and waited until the dawn came? No. It was meaningless to expect such a good luck while combating with the enemies.<br>
The only thing he could do now was to fight for a way out on his own -- this is the conclusion Evarist draw after consideration.<br>
Were they the Control Faction? Or the enemy country? Or even the Extension Faction who thought they've already got me under control? Although he couldn't say for sure where these people came from or who's behind all these, he knew certainly they wouldn't let go such a good opportunity like this tonight.<br>
He still couldn't sense any movements, so he decided to move again once he finished adjusting his breath.<br>
|<br>
After approaching ahead for a while along the few road lamps on his way out, a man appeared in front of him. His movements seemed almost lifeless.<br>
Even though it was late and dark at night, his red cloak still stood out and couldn't be mistaken. The attackers did not come from the Control Faction or the Extension Faction, they didn't even belong to the enemy country they were now having a war with. That man with the mask was the head of the Inquisitors.<br>
“The minions of the engineers...”<br>
Being one of the remaining team members of the ??, Evarist soon realized why these Inquisitors would came looking for him.<br>
“...don't you think you are a bit too late?”<br>
The pain caused by his arm wound had become stronger and stronger. Not to mention the fact that he didn't even have a chance to stop the bleeding.<br>
“...”<br>
The man wearing a mask held up his weapon as reply.<br>
“My apologies. But I do not have any time to waste on the deads.”<br>
Right after he spoke to the mask man, Evarist took out his gun and shot at him immediately. However, that mask man just waved his hand slightly, and the bullet was taken down by the swords tightened in his hands.<br>
That was no ordinary move everyone could easily achieve.<br>
Then, the man with a mask was suddenly standing right in front of Evarist and wielded his sword toward Evarist's neck. Evarist managed to dodge the attack in the most critical moment and threw the gun on the ground, grabbing his sword instead. The mask man's attack came quickly and heavily. The clang sound of metal hitting each other echoed through the late night city. Although he could manage to block the attacks -- though barely -- he could never find a chance to attack back. Not to mention he was bleeding even more heavily now.<br>
The reason Evarist would struggle these hard this time wasn't just because he was injured. Evarist could still recall clearly that while combating, only those from his team members could be fighting neck and neck with each other.<br>
Then, all of a sudden, that man with a mask stopped the attack. The breath sound came under his mask became heavier, too. Something had obviously changed.<br>
Evarist soon realized what would happen during his next attack. It was much heavier and sharper than before. And since that his arms had already felt numbness due to those numerous attacks before, he had no choice but to jump back and widen the distance between them.<br>
“You learned all your skills from the team, didn't you? I just don't understand why you would become one of those guys' minions.”<br>
The man with a mask did not speak a word, as if he couldn't hear Evarist at all. He just ignored Evarist's provocation completely and shortened their distance once more.<br>
Meanwhile, Evarist grabbed the chance and gave that man's attacking pattern a quick assessment. Although it looked quite unique upon first sight, it actually had a very regular pattern. So just like what Evarist had expected, his attack after shortening the distance was exactly the move Evarist predicted. Evarist successfully hit that man on his mask with the one move that terrified everyone in the past -- The Thorn.<br>
The mask man fell on his knees after taking the hit.<br>
“Everything is over now, go back to your past!”<br>
However, just when Evarist was about to launch the last strike, he felt a strong wave hitting hard on his abdomen.<br>
Evarist was now holding his sword high and stared down at the other sword stabbed on him. It came from the mask man's wrist.<br>
“Argh...”<br>
Evarist fell down to ground momentarily, losing all his strength. But he was still conscious.<br>
“No...not yet...”<br>
Evarist struggle to stand up, lying and waving his hands on the ground.<br>
He reached out to grab his sword, though he was still on his back and tried to use it to support himself. But the mask man had already stepped on his hand.<br>
No, he couldn't just die here. If he were meant to lose everything here, what's the point of living till now?<br>
Evarist struggled to lift the arm that was unharmed and used it to free his other hand. There's no way he would die like this here, not even a chance, Evarist thought and struggled hard to free himself.<br>
“Damn...not yet...”<br>
Evarist's blood was spreading all over on the ground. But the harder he struggled, the quicker he was losing all his blood. He couldn't see the mask man's expression either. He seemed to be considering his options and wanted to decide whether he should take a last look of Evarist or just finished him instantly.<br>
Then a very loud gun shot came at the most critical moment, making the mask man jumping away for Evarist.<br>
“Hey!”<br>
Although he already had difficulties staying conscious, Evarist still recognized that voice. He could never mistake that rude voice. It was Izac. He also saw a rifle aiming at the mask man.<br>
“You still want to fight?”<br>
Soldiers that respected Evarist the most appeared one by one after Izac gestured toward them. Dawn will come in no time.<br>
The mask man hesitated a moment, but gave up and lowered his weapon eventually, walking away from Izac and the soldiers.<br>
“Is it alright to let him walk?”<br>
One of the soldiers asked as a matter of fact.<br>
“He is our priority right now. Go bring the medical team!” He said, pointing at Evarist.<br>
“Yes, sir!”<br>
Izac sat next to Evarist, who was injured badly and pressed the gauze hard on his wound. He then supported Evarist's head with his hand.<br>
“Don't die, Eva! You can't just end like this, remember?”<br>

41,127,1,"Year 3386. - The Past -",1,"It was very foggy that day. And though that it had long past the darkest hour at night, the first dawn had not yet arrived either. The heavy fog made it very difficult to see through what's ahead of them. However, Bernhard still stood straight in this heavy fog.<br>
He was surrounded by numerous knee-high tombstones. Each and every tombstone here was engraved with a single name.<br>
This was the cemetery where they buried all the regiment soldiers who lost their lives when fighting with the Vortex. When they combated with the Vortex, the battle was always too intense for them to bring back any of these soldiers' bodies; therefore, they only have tombstones here, nothing more. However, it was still necessary for them to have a place used for memorizing the dead.<br>
Bernhard stooped down before one of the tombstones and put down a bouquet gently.<br>
After praying silently for a short while, Bernhard opened hid eyes and looked at the tombstone. He then spoke out solemnly.<br>
“Why don't you show yourself up?”<br>
A trainee appeared next to him.<br>
“I am truly sorry, sir, for I don't think I should disturb you.”<br>
“What are you doing here in this time of day?”<br>
“I woke up a little bit earlier today. But I really don't mean to bother you, not at all.”<br>
“I am not blaming you. This neighborhood is indeed a good place to take a walk.”<br>
“It's quiet here.”<br>
“Hmmm, I think they should be able to rest peacefully here.”<br>
Evarist took another look at the tombstone. It said: Krouz Rodar, -- 3377.<br>
“Who was this?”<br>
Bernhard also took a look at the tombstone after Evarist asked him this question.<br>
“A man who had taught me...”<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“Ugh...”<br>
He waved his sword and took down the giant worm just jumped straight on to him while trying to protect the Core hidden safely behind him.<br>
He had already used up his last rifle bullet, the only weapon left was this sword only. But he was bleeding hard on his shoulder, and his vision started to blurry too.<br>
Bernhard and some of his teammates had invaded the Vortex as an advanced troop trying to scout around for information.<br>
They were safe and sound all the way until they reached the Core. While they walked through the wandering tunnels, they didn't even encounter any of the enemies, not even one. However, there were a bunch of giant bugs flying toward them suddenly long before they realized.<br>
Although these bugs are not that dangerous or too difficult to take down, there were just too many of them. Therefore, all the young team members were soon defeated, leaving Bernhard being the only one who's still able to fight.<br>
Am I going to die here? All the excitements and agitations he had felt vanished instantly, making him just want to give up and run away. However, knowing that he must protect the Core and make sure it's safe; Bernhard did not quit but launch another strike once more.<br>
The main force should arrive here in any minute. So if he, Bernhard, could secure the Core until then, it will definitely be easier for them to retrieve the lost land. He couldn't die before that, no matter what.<br>
He then took down numerous bugs once more and was covered with his own blood and those bugs' body fluid from head to toe. There were dead bugs' bodies all over the place.<br>
Bernhard had long reached his strength limits. The only reason he could still move his limps was his determination to secure the Core.<br>
“...Mmmmm...!”<br>
Suddenly, he seemed to hear something around him and see some movements around the corner too. He stabbed his sword toward that direction instinctively, even though he was now barely conscious.<br>
Clang!<br>
Someone or something blocked his sword.<br>
“...Bernhard, stay with me! Be strong!”<br>
His blurry vision started to clear a little bit. A familiar male face appeared in front of him.<br>
“...Sergeant?”<br>
It was the sergeant of their team, Krouz.<br>
“That's right, it's me. You did well.”<br>
“The Core...is...secured...”<br>
“I know.”<br>
Krouz smiled at Bernhard while supporting him with his own arm so that Bernhard won't fall down.<br>
“We will take it from here now, and you are coming back with us after we retrieve the Core.”<br>
The main force then took down those giant bugs one by one and started to retrieve the Core simultaneously.<br>
As for Bernhard, who could finally relax now, he was now sitting limply on the ground and watched his teammates finishing the work. Although they did help him stop the bleeding, he could still sense that his body was now turning cold slowly.<br>
The Engineers soon had the retrieving devices set up and ready to use. Those Engineers had already put the Chaosium linked to their world into the device. The light it radiated was covered as well while he watched; he knew the only thing left to do now was going back to the place they were ejected from the space force.<br>
“Hey, we are done now. Stay with me!”<br>
Krouz said to Bernhard, who almost fell unconscious.<br>
“...Please just leave me here.”<br>
Bernhard looked straight into Krouz' eyes. But Krouz only shook his head.<br>
“This is not for you to decide. This is an order. Stand up now, Bernhard.”<br>
Krouz lent his shoulder to Bernhard and helped him back on his feet again.<br>
“If we leave everyone having the same situation as you do now at wherever they are, we won't have anyone left in our team now. Besides, we still need you to work for the regiment. Now, let's go. We are taking you with us that's for sure.”<br>
Their armored corvette was parked outside the nest, so the only way to get there was on foot. Krouz was now walking together with Bernhard while the other force member marching slightly ahead of them.<br>
Then all of a sudden, the regiment just retrieved the Core was attacked by lots of giant bugs again. These bugs surrounded the whole regiment very soon, launching their strikes again and again.<br>
“We are almost back to the armored corvette! Stay in line and keep close!”<br>
Krouz scolded at the team members. Luckily the regiment wasn't hurt badly, and they had Bernhard return to the corvette safely as well.<br>
“Good, we can see the corvette now!”<br>
“We are almost there!”<br>
After killing numerous bugs, the regiment finally made it to the outskirts of worm nest, where they parked their armored corvette. However, there soon came a sad moaning sound that was loud enough to muffle the happy cheers their team members made.<br>
“Watch out behind! There came a giant guy!”<br>
Bernhard turned around and saw a giant bug. He was so huge that was even larger than the armored corvette. His body was covered by hard, shiny golden black shells too.<br>
“Attack! Don't let it get close to the corvette!”<br>
Krouz gave the order and all the rifles were now shooting at the giant beetle. However, all of the bullets were being blocked by its hard shell, making the giant beetle completely unhurt.<br>
“Damn you monster. Fighting with him will only waste our time! Everyone retreats now! Retreat to the armored corvette, now!”<br>
Krouz gave another order while the rest of the team securing the Core and retreating to the corvette at the same time. The other regiment responsible for guarding the corvette started to cover for the retreating regiment and headed back with them together.<br>
Unfortunately, with his condition and injury right now, Bernhard would only slow the whole team down undoubtedly.<br>
“Please just put me down...and hurry up! It will definitely catch you all if you choose otherwise!”<br>
Bernhard yelled at Krouz, who was now supporting him with his own shoulder and dragging him along. In fact, there were already numerous bugs flying toward the corvette since the regiments had held their fire and started to retreat.<br>
But Krouz still insisted on taking him back.<br>
“...I won't even think about it. And you shouldn't give up so early either.”<br>
He then called out a few team members and asked them to take care of Bernhard from now on.<br>
“Take him back along with you. I will go take care of that giant thing.”<br>
Suddenly, the giant bug growled angrily and marched toward the corvette.<br>
“Yes, sir!”<br>
“But sergeant, there's no time...”<br>
After retrieving the Core, the Vortex will self-destruct itself after a certain time. Therefore, if they don't get out of this world before then, they would never be able to go back again.<br>
“I understand the risk. Do not wait for me. Just go, now!”<br>
Krouz reloaded his rifle gun after saying so.<br>
“Take good care of them from now on.”<br>
Krouz waved his fist toward Bernhard and left quickly.<br>
“...Sergeant!”<br>
Bernhard was so shocked that he was now totally speechless.<br>
By the time he spun around, Krouz had long rushed into those giant bugs.<br>
Bernhard and the rest of team made to the corvette safe and sound eventually.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“We took off right after they took me back to the corvette.”<br>
When Bernhard finished his story, Evarist looked down at the tombstone once more silently. Krouz' body did not lie underneath it.<br>
“We regiment soldiers will all die eventually, but not without taking down the Vortex with us.”<br>
Bernhard said lightly while the first dawn lightened up his face.<br>
“Gaining something is never the reason we live-- to end all this is.”<br>
Evarist was rendered speechless.<br>
“It's necessary for you to realize and understand this. If not, you should better leave soon.”<br>
“...yes, I do. I do understand it.”<br>
“Good, then. For that the world will be entrusted to your hands one day.”<br>
Bernhard left right after told him so.<br>
The morning dews shone brightly under the golden dawn.<br>

42,137,1,"Year 3386. - The Lanista -",1,"“What's wrong with you, Friedrich? Taking care of these newbies? Why don't you just retire and focus on being a Lanista then?”<br>
“Oh, Shut up. If you are truly envy of me, why not just take over my duty?”<br>
His teammate from the same year told Friedrich so while he passing by.<br>
On the other hand, Friedrich--who had no interest at all in this originally--had started to feel that it might not actually be a bad thing to be a instructor lecturing all the trainees after all.<br>
“All right, everyone. Let's call it a day now, and listen up! Make sure you all have enough food stuffed in your stomach, understood?”<br>
While Friedrich spoke, there were already several trainees flopped down exhaustingly.<br>
These trainees, who had started their training in the end of last year all belonged to Regiment Term Fifteen. And although they all became much stronger over the past few months, one could still see the na・e expression showing on their faces.<br>
This situation--that even them, these youngster (if not teenagers) had to keep fighting was already abnormal enough. However, running around and yelling loudly: “It's not normal!” won't change the fact that their world was invading by Vortex bits by bits either.<br>
Therefore, Friedrich felt that the least they could do was to train them and help these young men survive. And among all the training officers, Abel and Leon from Term Thirteen were most special, for that they had already had numerous experiences of actual combats and rescuing to pass on. All the new regiment members had to be trained for three whole years, and everyone would be lectured by Abel and Leon while the training almost came to an end as well.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
This event happened during the evening that day.<br>
All the trainees were still practicing with Friedrich and other training offices even though it had already passed noon time. And after the training session was completed, they gave all the trainees some free time.<br>
Each of them had different use of their precious free time; some of them started to practice again on their own, some others headed out instead, some preferred to read, and the others were playing games. Those who were from the same term or got along with each other would form a little clan of their own that's for sure. And even though they were members of the regiment, they were still vigorous youngsters that were full of sap, so it's not uncommon for them to mess around or create troubles either.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Friedrich was eating late lunch while everything happened, but he still noticed the dispute those trainees were having in the atrium.<br>
“...not again. Argh...what should I do with them...”<br>
Friedrich murmured to himself and opened the window, trying to have a good look of what had happened.<br>
“Hey you, young boy, trying to be a smart ass, aren't you? How about show me some smiley faces, huh?”<br>
The young man who was talking and pressing hard on Evarist's shoulder was not very tall.<br>
Further away from where they were stood another bunch of trainees, including Abel from Term Thirteen who was observing everything in the middle. These rookies had long getting used to the life in regiment already, so were all standing far away and watching him making things difficult for Evarist.<br>
Evarist dangled a little bit, but did not fall down. He then closed his eyes after glancing the young man in front of him.<br>
“...let's go, Izac.”<br>
He told Izac, who was standing next to him.<br>
“Wait a minute, you glasses boy!”<br>
The young man got pissed off and punched Evarist in the face--probably because he felt humiliated in front of his peers.<br>
“...Urgh.”<br>
Although Evarist did duck away instantly, his eye glasses still fell to the ground because of that young man.<br>
The young man took a look at the eye glasses and stepped on them, smiling viciously.<br>
“Oh, I am so sorry about this. Are they very important to you?”<br>
The group watching from behind laughed altogether, making Izac clenches his fists tightly.<br>
“Just ignore them, Izac.”<br>
“What about you, huh? Are you doing this one over here?”<br>
Izac punched hard at that young man's stomach. He was so fast that Evarist could not even stop him beforehand.<br>
“Ouch!”<br>
Being hit hard caused the young man squirmed painfully on the ground. He whimpered weakly. His face was all covered by tears and nasal mucus. Leon hurried toward them and helped that young man stand up again.<br>
“Wanna have a fight, huh? You newbie!”<br>
Abel closed the distance between himself and Izac, staring right into his face. Izac, on the other hand, stepped backward and pulled out the practicing knife tied on his waist.<br>
“Interesting, you want to compete with me, don't you?”<br>
Abel also pulled out his knife quickly and pointed it at Izac.<br>
Abel, who was two terms senior to them, was particular good at wielding the sword. He was so good at it that even the training officers were not his opponents at all.<br>
“Abel, take him down!”<br>
“We know you can definitely finish guys like him within one move!”<br>
“Forget it, it's not a big deal. Don't get too agitated.”<br>
“...let go of me!”<br>
Izac batted away Evarist's hand.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“Oh well...this is definitely not going to end well.”<br>
Friedrich, who saw everything from the very first beginning stood up.<br>
Friedrich knew both Abel and Izac very well. He knew exactly what they were capable of. He knew that Abel was underestimating Izac, and Izac was being over-reacted.<br>
If they did have a fight, the result won't be good at all. Even though they were just using practicing knives, they could still hurt each other badly if they wanted to.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“What about it? Bring it on you newbie!”<br>
“...”<br>
While Abel kept waving his practicing knife constantly, Izac just stood there holding his sword and stared at Abel.<br>
“What? Well, if you are truly this scared, I will then launch the strike first.”<br>
Abel waved his sword hard and stabbed toward Evarist. He looked quite anxious about Izac standing still and totally unmoved. And just at that very critical moment, Izac finally waved his practicing sword and stabbed directly toward Abel's throat.<br>
“Wow...”<br>
Facing an attack that was so powerful, Abel did not react properly in time. Everyone, including him, thought Izac would cut through Abel's throat with that sword.<br>
However, something shiny and silver suddenly appeared.<br>
Friedrich used his sword to block down the fatal attack at that very critical moment.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“So far so good, you two. Practicing with your sword is a good thing indeed; however, why don't you have some rest now and resume it tomorrow?”<br>
“...tsk.”<br>
Abel, whose face was black with rage retrieved his sword furiously. Izac, on the other hand, let out a breath deeply after seeing Abel put the sword back and did the same.<br>
“We're not done yet!”<br>
Abel left with his gang after saying so.<br>
“Come on, let's go, Izac.”<br>
Evarist picked up his broken eye glasses and headed back toward the dorm with Izac after saluting at Friedrich.<br>
“Sigh, they are just kiddos indeed.”<br>
Friedrich murmured to himself.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
That night, Friedrich asked Izac to meet him in the training officers' office.<br>
Friedrich was sitting along in the room with a wine glass in his hand.<br>
“Oh, here you are. Come and have a sit.”<br>
“...”<br>
Izac remained unmoved with his fists clenching tight and stared into Friedrich's eyes.<br>
“You have nothing to worry about. I won't do anything to you.”<br>
“Then may I ask why you would ask me to come and meet you here, sir?”<br>
“Just come and have a sit first. We won't be able to talk if you insist on standing there.”<br>
Friedrich urged him to take a sit, making Izac have no choice but to comply.<br>
“Want to have a drink?”<br>
Friedrich poured some red wine and put the wine glass in front of Izac.<br>
“Why would you ask me to meet you here, sir?”<br>
“Argh, relax, Izac. There's no need to be this intense.”<br>
Friedrich put down the wine glass after drinking everything in one go.<br>
“You were trying to kill Abel this afternoon, were you not?”<br>
“Yes, I was.”<br>
“And it won't even matter if you were dead, am I right?”<br>
Izac was rendered speechless.<br>
“All men could prepare themselves to kill someone one way or another. However, it's not that common to see a man being ready for his own death momentarily.”<br>
“It's quite remarkable of you actually, especially consider how young you are.”<br>
“...are these all you have to say, sir?”<br>
Friedrich waved his hand toward Izac, who was just about to leave, and continued.<br>
“I have high expectation of you, Izac.”<br>
“Every man has one life only, including you. Do not waste it on such a boring dispute.”<br>
“...”<br>
Izac did not reply, but had regained his calmness once more.<br>
“There will be another time more appropriate to sacrifice your own life. Save it until then.”<br>
“...I understand it now, sir.”<br>
“Good. Off you go then.”<br>
“If you would excuse me, sir.”<br>
Izac left the office after saluting to Friedrich.<br>
Friedrich poured another red wine for himself.<br>
“Well, it seems that we all need to fight some real combats now, me and them both.”<br>
He murmured quietly to himself once more.<br>

43,167,1,"- The Hope -",1,"It's been several days since they left the forest. They just kept walking, trying to stay as far away as possible from the forest. Their original goal was to use the forest as a safety shelter; however, the whole forest had already been invaded by the Worms, leaving absolutely nothing behind but numerous wastelands. There was no way they could find a safe place to stay.<br>
Although all the adults were pretending they didn't notice this, people were missing one by one gradually. Regarding this futureless journey, not everyone could make it through successfully.<br>
Though that some of them were just taking a break and intended to [catch up later], none of them actually came back.<br>
Gramma had long stopped caring about this, for that she also started to understand it was meaningless to keep escaping. Nevertheless, she's still here with them and kept relocating like everyone else in order to stay away from the Worms.<br>
As for the return of Ayn, Gramma wasn't that pessimistic in the first place. However, after all these time strolling through the wastelands in the forest, she had also started to lose her faith bits by bits.<br>
Even Ayn did come back with that precious ore and seal the Worms once again; the Black Holl had already eaten everything. There won't be anything left in this world no matter what.<br>
That forest -- the forest that nursed and raised Spout and her tribe -- was now so, so far away.<br>
The whole tribe was enveloped by the gloomy feeling of despair and why not just giving up?<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
One day, the sun did not rise as usual. The shiny light that always lighten up the whole forest just disappeared, leaving everywhere completely in the dark. The sky was covered by grey clouds all over the place, making the day as dark as night and the night even darker.<br>
This situation made everyone feel even more despaired than before.<br>
“The Worms are eating our sky now.” Some people told others so, though no one had actually witnessed this happening.<br>
That day, the journey of escaping from the Worms came to an end.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Gramma began her story by telling them rumor has it those Worms were actually magicians very long time ago. And how she wished they could regain their conscious soon once more.<br>
But now, Sprout felt it was only an impossible dream that would never come true. There's no way those squirming, giant bugs would ever possess [conscious], she thought.<br>
To Sprout, they might as well call it the death it self.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Now, there's nothing around them where Sprout and her folks were. They were supposed to rest by a small lake on this deserted wasteland. But now, there was nothing left but a huge hole. The trees around it were all withered too, with their brown, dry branches standing out in the grey sky.<br>
Sprout was standing next to a withered tree. After contemplating for quite a while, she finally figured out one thing--the world they are living in now and the one that's been haunting her in her nightmare were exactly the same.<br>
This withered branch that looked like an old man's arm, the despaired adults around her and the sky that's so dark and grey--she had already seen all of these numerous times before in her dreams. She then remembered what's going to happen too.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Suddenly, there came a severe earthquake right at where everyone was staying and where the lake used to be. And the shakes got stronger and stronger, until no one could stand steadily on their feet anymore. People were crying, yelling, laughing or just being silent.<br>
Sprout grabbed hold of the withered tree tightly, trying to take a close look at what's about to happen. But soon enough, she could no longer see anything clear for that everything within her vision was enveloped by darkness gradually. The ground beneath her started to collapse and dissolve too; causing everything fell into that endless black hole led to the hell.<br>
Sprout began meditating so that she could wake up from this nightmare.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, purple, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, purple... she was now in a colorful new world that made her spin and couldn't take hier eyes off all the changing colors around her.<br>
Although she couldn't even figure out the direction in this brand new world, she didn't feel against it or disgusted either. Even though she was now floating in mid air and couldn't land on her feet, she could still make her way toward the direction she wanted to move forward to.<br>
Even if this truly was the place she meant to arrive after that nightmare, Sprout knew it couldn't be that lovely hometown she always wanted to go back to either.<br>
With all the people and new things she cam across along the way in this new world, she was more than sure of it. She could even see those soldiers who went killing the Worms--even though Gramma was against it--but never came back now.<br>
Those soldiers were now moving toward Sprout after seeing her. They didn't look particularly happy.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“Argh...even you are finally here.”<br>
They patted Spout's head gently one by one after saying this.<br>
“Where am I? Are we dead?”<br>
Those soldiers made some very sad sounds after hearing Spout's question. They crossed their arms in front of their chests and looked very bothersome. They didn't answer her question immediately.<br>
“Who knows? No one really knows the answer, don't you think?”<br>
Then, a giant hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed one of the soldiers. That soldier didn't even have time running away from it. Everything was happening so fast that Sprout didn't have time to react properly or even scream, all she could do right now was staring at that giant hand.<br>
That hand seemed to be made from clouds. It was half-transparent, like it wasn't even real.<br>
When that hand finally loosened its grip, the solider was nowhere to be seen. This place was definitely not a safe one either. Realizing this, people started to flee away like frightened birds.<br>
But not Sprout, because she just couldn't run away. Even though this was a place people could move around whenever they wanted to, Sprout just couldn't make a single move no matter how hard she tried.<br>
That giant hand soon grabbed another soldier and made him disappear too. No matter how strong and how well-trained they were, all the soldiers could do nothing but to watch it helplessly.<br>
Then, if you watched it closely, you would notice that thing did not only own a hand but the whole body. It was actually a very giant man. Therefore, no matter how fast one could run, they would all be caught by the giant eventually.<br>
Finally, the giant hand came looking for Sprout as well. But she had long lost all her strength and stamina to resist or run away.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
Her vision became blurrier and blurrier. Sprout felt like she was now wrapped by the clouds.<br>
Then all of a sudden, she heard a strange sound speaking right next to her ear. That sound belonged to a young man she had never heard of before.<br>
“What's you wish?”<br>
Although all of this were happening so suddenly, she had a very strong feeling that she must answer the question.<br>
“I want to restore everything! I want to see Ayn!” Sprout shouted.<br>
“Then why not pray it harder?”<br>
The young boy's voice was heard everywhere, asking Sprout to picture a new world in her mind that could end the whole nightmare.<br>
“May you enjoy this new world, my girl!”<br>
Spout lost her conscious once again while hearing that voice.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
She could still that rough but gentle feeling on her cheek. But she could no longer describe her encounter with that giant properly. It all felt like a dream.<br>
And though that she's still suspicious of everything, it did look like she was saved from death.<br>
Sprout stared at that beast which just woke her up as if it was an alarm clock. Though it looked like a wolf, she could sense that it also owned some human nature a beast shouldn't possessed.<br>
She stood up and looked around hrr surrounding. There were no Worms or dark hole, not anymore. However, all her folks were gone too.<br>
She was standing in a beautiful dense forest, a forest Sprout had never known before.<br>
Sprout could feel the warm sun shining through the woods and the peaceful feeling it brought. She then felt deeply exhausted after going through all these strange experiences.<br>
She closed her eyes and prayed that this wasn't just another dream.<br>
|<br>
***<br>
|<br>
“Is she the child we are looking for?”<br>
A woman stood next to Sprout asked. Sprout was now sleeping soundly.<br>
“Yes.”<br>
That woman looked like she was talking to someone else. However, there wasn't anyone around but her and her alone.<br>
“Relax. I won't leave her like this. Excuse me, but could you help me carry her, please?”<br>
The beast went holding Spout in its mouth immediately after hearing what the woman said and laid her on its back.<br>

44,20052,1,"I WANT YOU !",1,"Deep within Valley of the Witch lies a hall of sublime majesty.<br>
There, the HERALDS discovered by the Goddess of the Fire pass their days as they wait for the hour when they will come to confront their own memories.<br>
|<br>
“So bored.”<br>
Lying desultorily face-down on the sofa in the room provided for him to wait within, Gustave had been passing his own days inactive and idle.<br>
The Guider had locked itself away in its room under the pretense of taking a “rest,” and if Gustave were to try to explore the valley beyond alone, the ACOLYTES were sure to stop him. He'd thought to make a specimen to kill time, but this world lacked the requisite tools, so even that he had to abandon.<br>
To state it directly, Gustave had time on his hands.<br>
He'd regained a fragment of the memories of his former life, but all this amounted to was a recollection of being on his organization's Throne deep below the surface of the earth, listening wearily to a report being made by a subordinate.<br>
“...all right.”<br>
Having long lost himself in idle thought, he had finally struck upon something. Wanting to put this something to practice, he left his room in triumphant spirits and began to make his way to the Hall's entrance.<br>
|<br>
Partway through his journey, he passed before a room filled with the echoes of mechanical clatter. He quietly opened the door, only to see Walken and C.C. repairing their equipment.<br>
Leaving the door open, he called out to the two then took up perch on an unused workbench.<br>
“A rare sight. You've come to fix your equipment, too, Gustave?”<br>
C.C. spoke to him from where she worked, nearby. Bizarre a person as she was, her skill in the engineering of mechanical artifacts was undeniable, and even Gustave had to marvel at the extent of her genius.<br>
Taking this as a fine bit of fortune, he set his aims on her.<br>
“Ah, is it that strange? Myself, I am the kind who likes to keep his equipment in ideal working condition at all times. My quarters were... lacking, so I simply happened to stop in, you see.”<br>
This couldn't be further from his actual purpose, but for now he'd join in on the thread of C.C.'s conversation.<br>
“I see. You want to regain your memories quickly as well, don't you? That's why you came.”<br>
“Indeed. I've grown weary of being here, unable to recollect a thing.”<br>
Without looking away from her equipment for a moment, she continued speaking with him.<br>
“Me, too! I've got this sense of impatience, like I need to get back to the surface as soon as possible.”<br>
“But hasn't quite a lot of time passed since we came here? I wonder if perhaps the world above has changed since then.”<br>
“Now that you mention it, maybe it has. Even if I do get back to the surface, I might not be able to return to PANDEMONIUM...”<br>
The conversation had come right to where he wanted it, and far sooner than he'd anticipated. Realizing this, Gustave snickered inwardly as he continued his chat with C.C.<br>
“Ohoh. If you're worried about not having a place to go, why not come work to your heart's content at my laboratory? My organization has deep roots in firm soil, so there's no worry of it having collapsed.”<br>
“...are you headhunting me?”<br>
“If that's how you care to see it, I don't mind. One can never have enough talented mechanists.”<br>
Gustave had come to think that with a little good fortune he could bring new vigor to the organization in this world by making allies of those here at the Saint's Hall.<br>
Simply the work involved in trying to skillfully lure over these headstrong HERALDS promised entertainment enough. In short, it could become a lovely combination of play and profit for him.<br>
|<br>
“Hmm, you make an interesting proposition.”<br>
“Don't tell me you're interested in what he's saying?”<br>
Marceus, who had seemed to be working on an equipment inspection, finally joined the conversation.<br>
However, he was not the sort of person to let your guard down around. If Gustave slipped up, there was a real possibility that it would be him who got dragged into something instead.<br>
“It all depends on circumstances. Surely people can create a relationship of mutual benefit even with differing goals?”<br>
“And what when two powerful allies go to 'mutually' share the benefit...?”<br>
The two men matched gazes.<br>
“If you could give some sort of evidence your words could be trusted, then perhaps they'd be worth listening to. For example, if you were to, let's say, explain the nature of your extra-worldly abilities.”<br>
“What a delectable thing to suggest! The same could be asked of you, yes? I have always wanted to know more of the mystery that surrounds your master, the one whom you call the Immortal Emperor.”<br>
The atmosphere between the two was by effort a warm one. However, any observer would realize that no warmth at all dwelt in either of their eyes.<br>
Just as they were about to choose, with prudence and caution, the necessary words to draw out the other's true nature, the conversation was brought to a halt from an unexpected source.<br>
“...if you're not here to work, please leave.”<br>
As quiet as they were, those words evinced obvious displeasure, and the two men fell silent.<br>
“Ohoh. For today, let us heed Walken's words.”<br>
“What? You're leaving already?”<br>
As he stood to go, Gustave cast a sidelong glance at the seemingly-crestfallen C.C. It would be regrettable if he lost any future opportunities by stepping on too many toes here.<br>
“C.C., they're getting in the way of our work.”<br>
“I was kind of interested in what he was saying, though...”<br>
“Get the details next time. If we've a surplus of anything, it's time, after all.”<br>
“I guess. Next time, then.”<br>
Turning his back to Marseus's words, Gustave left the workshop with haste.<br>
|<br>
Continuing on to the Hall's entrance, he passed Milian and Leta, but the two were so engrossed in their conversation that they didn't seem to notice Gustave at all.<br>
Just as he was about to push in nonetheless, unconcerned with how tasteless it might be disturb the dialogue between parent and child, he spotted Clovis coming from the direction of the entrance.<br>
“If it isn't Gustave. I thought you were in your room.”<br>
“I was, but then I hit upon an excellent way to kill some time.”<br>
Gustave then explained his idea. Nodding once, Clovis fell in behind Gustave.<br>
|<br>
At the entrance were Donita, completely absorbed in a picture book, and Nenem, fixing the seam of Donita's headdress.<br>
The two of them were both females shrouded in mystery. One an automaton, created with technology now long-lost, and the other a young girl with the power to control ageing. For the sake of the organization, both would be excellent acquisitions.<br>
“Oh, Clovis? What's wrong? And you brought Gustave with you, too.”<br>
“Just a minor matter.”<br>
Surprised at the return of Clovis, who'd been at the entrance until just recently, Nenem had started to converse with the men.<br>
“That so? Well, deal with it quickly, then. And Nenem, stop blathering at everyone who comes by. It's distracting.”<br>
“Such harsh words. We were simply in the middle of considering what to do when we return to the surface.”<br>
The two girls exchanged looks.<br>
“Hasn't quite a lot of time passed since we came to the Hall? One must consider that on returning to the world above, some of us may not have a place to return to.”<br>
“I don't know where I'll go, but it is a little worrisome, isn't it.”<br>
“Our organization has a presence in almost every region. For us two, it's nigh-unthinkable that we'll have any difficulties, but not everyone here can say that. We'd like to extend a helping hand to anyone who has any worries or concerns to that effect.”<br>
“What Gustave is saying is that our organization will help you out until you've gotten back on your feet. In exchange, we'd like to get your help with a few little things. That's what we were thinking.”<br>
“What? What is that, even? Seems fishy. Anyway, I'm busy right now. Don't bother me.”<br>
With that said, Donita once again turned her attention back to her picture book. The atmosphere of pointed disinterest she emitted was almost palpable.<br>
“Maybe we will remember a place we can return to, soon.”<br>
Even Nenem, who probably didn't fully understand the implications of the conversation, would only give them a non-committal reply.<br>
Nothing would come of his efforts, given these circumstances. Just as Gustave had begun to think this, a voice spoke out.<br>
“What's all the fuss about, you lot?”<br>
Just then leaving Rood's shop, Cobb leapt into the conversation. Seeing a small paper bag in his hands, Gustave assumed he'd just finished buying something.<br>
“We're stuck listening to Gustave's weird little pitch. You'll see what I mean when you hear it.”<br>
In a tone of voice dripping with malice, Donita announced this to Cobb without a moment's hesitation.<br>
“What a rude little girl, calling people's conversation 'weird.' All we were saying is that if you happen to encounter difficulties on return to the surface, please don't hesitate to call on our help.”<br>
“Hrmph? What's that mean?”<br>
“Upon returning to the world above, you may find there's nothing waiting for you. Given that, we were telling these girls that our organization would be glad to support anyone as they rebuilt their lives above.”<br>
“How wonderful that would be for you, if someone took you up on that. I wonder how steep the bill would be for all that 'support.'”<br>
A biting retort. Then again, that was exactly what one should expect from the young leader of a criminal organization.<br>
“We'd do nothing more than ask a few favors, as a kind of recompense for room and board. Surely that's not bad.”<br>
“Not bad, you say, but turn that around and what you got is something that isn't good, either.”<br>
This time, it bit to the bone. Gustave had hardly finished thinking of what to say before Cobb had cut in at the next instant.<br>
“Ahhh! No more! All of you, just shut up!! Didn't I just tell you not to bother me?!”<br>
Turning toward the source of this glass-shattering screech, Gustave saw Donita closing in, her scythe swinging wildly above her head.<br>
“Donita, please calm d--”<br>
“What's that, Nenem? You want to be cut to bits, too?!”<br>
Shaking off Nenem's attempt at restraint, Donita came charging at Gustave in a berserker rage, her scythe's blade aimed to take off his head.<br>
“Gustave, let's withdrawal for now. It won't do if we start causing trouble, here and now.”<br>
“No other choice, I suppose. Let's go.”<br>
Evading Donita's attacks with ease, the two men ran off to the front doors of the Hall.<br>
“--what?! Get back here, you useless sacks of filth!!”<br>
Just a moment too late, Cobb screamed out something to their retreating figures. However, Cobb too was the veteran of countless battles, and Gustave decided to ignore his bellows, assuming he'd survive it all somehow. Whenever they next went out for exploration together, he was sure to get an earful, but he'd figure out how to slip past that when the time came.<br>
Thinking these thoughts with Donita in pursuit, Gustave and Clovis left the Hall.<br>
|<br>
Outside, the most hot-headed and energetic of the HERALDS were making a cacophonous clamor, all under the guise of “training.”<br>
Not seeing anyone who seemed open to conversation, the two began looking about under the semblance of a stroll. However, they were hard-pressed to find a single HERALD suitable to their purposes.<br>
Florence and Schillerlee came running past at incredible speed, and all the two could do was watch them pass. Izac and Epsilon were completely focused on their mock battle, but Gustave felt that if he tried to intrude, he'd only get drawn into the conflict. Afterwards, they came across Orang, Jead, and Archibald, all carrying a massive amount of food, but it looked like any attempt at conversation would lead to simply being press-ganged into helping carry the goods.<br>
As interested as he was in Jead and Archibald's powers, Gustave decided it wasn't worth the risk of being questioned by an ACOLYTE, so he was forced to make up some half-hearted excuse then beat his retreat.<br>
|<br>
Having not managed to achieve the results they so hope for, the two made their way around to the rear of the Hall, where there was a garden under Rood's care.<br>
There they saw Wilhelm sitting on a bench, seemingly taking a break from some kind of physical labor.<br>
“What do you want?”<br>
No sooner had Gustave entered his field of vision than the first words out of Wilhelm's mouth were ones of pronounced wariness.<br>
“No need to be so guarded. I've not come to do you any harm.”<br>
“Then why have you come? There's nothing here for you.”<br>
“Oh, it's nothing big. We were just talking about what plans to make for when we return to the surface.”<br>
“Some attempt to ensnare me again?”<br>
“No, not in the least. I intend simply to welcome with utmost respect the person who saved me: you, my benefactor. We'd like to present you with a position of excellent standing and an environment where you could pursue your love of gardening as much as you wish.”<br>
“Nothing you say is worth trusting. How many people have fallen for your honeyed tongue before, I wonder.”<br>
Though obvious from the beginning, this was not to be an easy battle. Just as Gustave was considering what words would work best to win over this opponent, Sprout came out of the garden, his hands covered in soil.<br>
“Wilhelm? This section's done. Hey, what's up?”<br>
Seeing the boy standing there, his head tilted in curiosity at him and Clovis, Gustave shifted the target of his words.<br>
“The therianthrope child, yes? We were just talking about what to do once we've returned to the world above. What will you do?”<br>
“Me? We-ell, I guess I wanna go wherever my sister is. I don't know if I can get back to the forest, though...”<br>
“If you happen to be sent back to our world, why don't you stay at mine? We could invite your sister or whomever and you two could live together there.”<br>
“You mean, I could live with my big sis...? ...really?!”<br>
Sprout's eyes alight, Gustave simply nodded to the boy's words. How wonderful it is that children are so very earnest, he thought.<br>
With just one final push, what he said from here must be chosen carefully.<br>
“Sprout, you can't trust a word this man says.”<br>
“What? But, but he said I could be with my sister...”<br>
Wilhelm had suddenly cut it. How desperate he must be, to try to prevent a child from entering the organization.<br>
|<br>
“Lieutenant Kurt, so this is where you were.”<br>
Apparently searching for Wilhelm, Grunwald appeared from around the front side of the Hall. In his hand was the corpse of a mushroom rabbit.<br>
“Ah, Your Majesty. You have finished hunting?”<br>
“Indeed. Oh, how rare, to see you two here. What's happened?”<br>
That's right, Gustave remembered. These two are master and servant. If I succeed in having the lord capitulate, his retainer Wilhelm may follow.<br>
However, even if he does not, there might be value in threatening Grunwald, using him as a shield.<br>
“Why, we were just speaking of what plans to make for our return to the surface.”<br>
“My lord, please don't. There is danger in what he says.”<br>
Again, Wilhelm thrust himself into the conversation. He stood in the space between Gustave and Grunwald, taking a stance as if to physically block out Gustave.<br>
“Is that so? Yet, what he says is quite interesting, is it not?”<br>
Hearing this, Gustave's eyes sparked.<br>
“It looks like your master knows better than you do.”<br>
“Clovis, you...!!”<br>
“Hold. I'd like you to continue talking.”<br>
Grunwald held his servant back, seemingly taken with the conversation.<br>
“We are currently looking for highly-talented souls. If you were to join with us, we could provide you with whatever it is you desire. If you desire war, we can give you the most suitable opportunities and status for that.”<br>
Hearing these words, Grunwald fell silent. For a while, he seemed to gather his thoughts.<br>
“What I need are blood and death. That, that I can realize in my own kingdom.”<br>
“A-ah, err, just so...”<br>
Stunned at the overwhelming force of the reply, Gustave was completely dumbfounded. To control this man would take enormous effort.<br>
“Never mind that. Lieutenant Kurt, we'll begin dismantling the prey. Make the preparations.”<br>
Grunwald turned his heels to the two men, making it clear that the conversation was over. Wilhelm nodded once in ascent and followed afterwards.<br>
“As you wish. I'll begin preparations immediately. Sprout, maybe it'd be best if you went and notified Rood.”<br>
“Ah, yeah, I'll do that. So anyway, Gustave, Clovis. See ya later!”<br>
With that, Sprout went following after the master and his servant.<br>
|<br>
The only ones left were Clovis and Gustave.<br>
Gustave heaved a deep sigh, feeling something almost akin to admiration for the strength of will of those who dwelt here in the Hall.<br>
“It appears we won't win them over so easily. I expected some difficulties, but to this extent?”<br>
“Just like us, they all have things they've got to do, too. It'd be tough trying to manipulate them to do as we'd want them to.”<br>
Still, there was some benefit to reap. Verbally parrying with so many strong-willed individuals left Gustave feeling stimulated and refreshed.<br>
There was far more meaning in action than in simply complaining of boredom and idleness. Thinking that and deciding to go out and look for his next target, Gustave suddenly saw Eureka coming from over by the Hall.<br>
“So this is where you two were flapping your jaws all this time?”<br>
“Ah, Eureka. What's happened?”<br>
“A certain doll was looking for you. You're to set out for exploration.”<br>
So, not an small amount of time had passed. Though he couldn't call his efforts this day a success, Gustave did manage to work through his excess of free time quite well.<br>
“Is that so? Well, then, I'll set out immediately. Eureka, Clovis: let's go.”<br>
“As our leader wishes.”<br>
Clovis and Eureka's voices spoke in concert. Hearing this, Gustave nodded with evident satisfaction.<br>
Grinning as if pleased with himself, he set off to meet with the Guider, his mind already considering what he'd next do to while away the hours.<br>
